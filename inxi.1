All short form options have long form variants \- see below for these and more 
advanced options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinxi\fR is a command line system information script built for console and 
IRC. It is also used a debugging tool for forum technical support to quickly 
ascertain users' system configurations and hardware. inxi shows system 
hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, gcc version(s), Processes, RAM 
usage, and a wide variety of other useful information.

\fBinxi\fR output varies depending on whether it is being used on CLI or IRC,
with some default filters and color options applied only for IRC use.
Script colors can be turned off if desired with \fB\-c 0\fR, or changed 
using the \fB\-c\fR color options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS section below.

.SH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi used on IRC automatically
filters out your network device MAC address, WAN and LAN IP, your \fB/home\fR
username directory in partitions, and a few other items.

Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this
filtering with the \fB\-z\fR option (\fB\-Fz\fR, for example). To override
the IRC filter, you can use the \fB\-Z\fR option. This can be useful in 
debugging network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

.SH TABLE OF CONTENTS
This man page is pretty long and information packed. It is divided into the 
following sections:

* \fBUSING OPTIONS\fR How to use the command line options.

* \fBSTANDARD OPTIONS\fR Primary data types trigger items.

* \fBFILTER OPTIONS\fR Apply a variety of output filters.

* \fBOUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS\fR Change default colors, widths, heights, output 
types, etc.

* \fBEXTRA DATA OPTIONS\fR What \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, and \fB\-xxx\fR add to 
the output per primary data type. 

* \fBADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS\fR What \fB\-a\fR adds to the output per primary
data type. These have a lot of information because this is advanced admin data,
which are not always intuitive or easy to understand.

* \fBADVANCED OPTIONS\fR Modify behavior or choice of data sources, and other 
advanced switches.

* \fBDEBUGGING OPTIONS\fR For development use mainly, or contributing datasets 
to the project.

* \fBDEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES\fR Only for advanced users,
sometimes something will hang the debuggers, this shows you various ways to get
around those failures.

* \fBSUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS\fR List of known good IRC clients. Not checked often,
let us know if something is not working.

* \fBRUNNING IN IRC CLIENT\fR How to run inxi in various IRC clients.

* \fBCONFIGURATION FILE\fR Configuration file locations and priority in using.

* \fBCONFIGURATION OPTIONS\fR Most of the commonly used configuration options,
along with sample values.

* \fBBUGS\fR How and where to report bugs.

* \fBHOMEPAGE\fR, \fBAUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE\fR, \fBSPECIAL THANKS TO 
THE FOLLOWING\fR These are self explanitory.

.SH USING OPTIONS
Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can either group the 
letters together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion, except when
using \fB \-t\fR. Note that if you use an option that requires an additional
argument, that must be last in the short form group of options. Otherwise
you can use those separately as well.

For example:
\fBinxi \-AG\fR | \fBinxi \-A \-G\fR | \fBinxi \-b\fR | \fBinxi \-c10\fR 
| \fBinxi \-FxxzJy90\fR | \fBinxi \-bay\fR

Note that all the short form options have long form equivalents, which are
listed below. However, usually the short form is used in examples in order to
keep things simple.

.SH STANDARD OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-A \fR, \fB\-\-audio\fR
Show Audio/sound device(s) information, including device driver. Shows active 
sound API(s) and sound server(s). 

Supported APIs: ALSA, OSS, sndio. Supported servers: aRts (artsd), Enlightened 
Sound Daemon (esound, esd), JACK, NAS (Network Audio System, nasd), PipeWire, 
PulseAudio, RoarAudio, sndiod.

Use \fB\-Ax\fR to show all sound APIs/servers detected, including inactive, 
\fB\-Axx\fR to see API/Server helper daemons/plugin/modules, and \fB\-Aa\fR to 
see API/sound server tools.

.nf
\fBAudio:
  Device\-1: C-Media CMI8788 [Oxygen HD Audio] driver: snd_virtuoso
  Device\-2: AMD Cedar HDMI Audio [Radeon HD 5400/6300/7300 Series]

.if

.TP
.B \-b \fR, \fB\-\-basic\fR
Show basic output, short form. Same as: \fBinxi \-v 2\fR

.TP
.B \-B \fR, \fB\-\-battery\fR
Show system battery (\fBID\-x\fR) data, charge, condition, plus extra 
information (if battery present). Uses \fB/sys\fR or, for BSDs without systctl 
battery data, use \fB\-\-dmidecode\fR to force its use. \fBdmidecode\fR does 
not have very much information, and none about current battery 
state/charge/voltage. Supports multiple batteries when using \fB/sys\fR or 
\fBsysctl\fR data.

Note that for \fBcharge:\fR, the output shows the current charge, as well as 
its value as a percentage of the available capacity, which can be less than 
the original design capacity. In the following example, the actual current 
available capacity of the battery is \fB22.2 Wh\fR.

\fBcharge: 20.1 Wh (95.4%)\fR

The \fBcondition:\fR item shows the remaining available capacity / original 
design capacity, and then this figure as a percentage of original capacity 
available in the battery.

\fBcondition: 22.2/36.4 Wh (61%)\fR

With \fB\-x\fR, or if voltage difference is critical, \fBvolts:\fR item shows 
the current voltage, and the \fBmin:\fR voltage. Note that if the current is 
below the minimum listed the battery is essentially dead and will not charge. 
Test that to confirm, but that's technically how it's supposed to work.

\fBvolts: 12.0 min: 11.4\fR

With \fB\-x\fR shows attached \fBDevice\-x\fR information (mouse, keyboard, 
etc.) if they are battery powered.

.TP
.B \-\-bluetooth\fR
.br
See \fB\-E\fR.

.TP
.B \-c \fR, \fB\-\-color\fR
.br
See \fBOUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-config\fR, \fB\-\-configuration\fR
Show active configuration values, by file, and exit.

.TP
.B \-C \fR, \fB\-\-cpu\fR
Show full CPU output (if each item available): basic CPU topology, model, type, 
L2 cache, average speed of all cores (if > 1 core, otherwise speed of the core), 
min/max speeds for CPU, and per CPU clock speed. More data available with 
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR, and \fB\-a\fR options. 

Explanation of CPU type (\fBtype: MT MCP\fR) abbreviations:

* \fBAMCP\fR \- Asymmetric Multi Core Processor. More than 1 core per CPU, and
more than one core type (single and multithreaded cores in the same CPU).

* \fBAMP\fR \- Asymmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU, but not 
identical in terms of core counts or min/max speeds).

* \fBMT\fR \- Multi/Hyper Threaded CPU (more than 1 thread per core, previously 
\fBHT\fR).

* \fBMST\fR \- Multi and Single Threaded CPU (a CPU with both Single and Multi 
Threaded cores).

* \fBMCM\fR \- Multi Chip Model (more than 1 die per CPU).

* \fBMCP\fR \- Multi Core Processor (more than 1 core per CPU).

* \fBSMP\fR \- Symmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU).

* \fBUP\fR \- Uni (single core) Processor.

Note that \fBmin/max:\fR speeds are not necessarily true in cases of 
overclocked CPUs or CPUs in turbo/boost mode. See \fB\-Ca\fR for alternate 
\fBbase/boost:\fR speed data, more granular cache data, and more.

Sample:
.nf
\fBCPU:
  Info: 2x 8\-core model: Intel Xeon E5\-2620 v4 bits: 64 type: MT MCP SMP
    cache: L2: 2x 2 MiB (4 MiB)
  Speed (MHz): avg: 1601 min/max: 1200/3000 cores: 1: 1280 2: 1595 3: 1416
    ... 32: 1634\fR
.fi

.TP
.B \-d \fR, \fB\-\-disk\-full\fR,\fB\-\-optical\fR
Show optical drive data as well as \fB\-D\fR HDD/SSD drive data. With \fB\-x\fR, 
adds a feature line to the output. Also shows floppy disks if present. Note 
that there is no current way to get any information about the floppy device 
that we are aware of, so it will simply show the floppy ID without any extra 
data. \fB\-xx\fR adds a few more features.

.TP
.B \-D \fR, \fB\-\-disk\fR
Show HDD/SSD drive info. Shows total drive space and used percentage. The drive 
used percentage includes space used by swap partition(s), since those are not 
usable for data storage. Also, unmounted partitions are not counted in drive use 
percentages since inxi has no access to the used amount.

If the system has RAID or other logical storage, and if inxi can determine 
the size of those vs their components, you will see the storage total raw and 
usable sizes, plus the percent used of the usable size. The no argument short 
form of inxi will show only the usable (or total if no usable) and used 
percent. If there is no logical storage detected, only \fBtotal:\fR and 
\fBused:\fR will show. Sample (with RAID logical size calculated):

\fBLocal Storage: total: raw: 5.49 TiB usable: 2.80 TiB used: 1.35 TiB 
(48.3%)\fR

Without logical storage detected:

\fBLocal Storage: total: 2.89 TiB used: 1.51 TiB (52.3%)\fR

Also shows per drive information: Disk ID, type (FireWire, Removable, USB if 
present), vendor (if detected), model, and size. See \fBExtra Data Options\fR 
(\fB\-x\fR options) and \fBAdmin Extra Data Options\fR (\fB\-\-admin\fR options) 
for many more features.

.TP
.B \-E\fR, \fB\-\-bluetooth\fR
Show bluetooth device(s), drivers. Show \fBReport:\fR with HCI ID, state, 
address per device (requires \fBbt\-adapter\fR or \fBhciconfig\fR), 
and if available (hciconfig only) bluetooth version (\fBbt\-v\fR). 
See \fBExtra Data Options\fR for more. 

If bluetooth shows as \fBstatus: down\fR, shows \fBbt\-service:\fR\fB state
and rfkill\fR software and hardware blocked states, and rfkill ID.

Note that \fBReport\-ID:\fR indicates that the HCI item was not able to be 
linked to a specific device, similar to \fBIF\-ID:\fR in \fB\-n\fR.

If your internal bluetooth device does not show, it's possible that
it has been disabled, if you try enabling it using for example:

\fBhciconfig hci0 up\fR

and it returns a blocked by RF\-Kill error, you can do one of these:

\fBconnmanctl enable bluetooth\fR

or

\fBrfkill list bluetooth\fR

\fBrfkill unblock bluetooth\fR

.TP
.B \-\-edid\fR
.br
Triggers full \fBEDID\fR data in Graphics, activates \fB\-G\fR and \fB\-a\fR.

\- Adds monitor chromacity (\fBchroma: red:..green:...blue:...white:\fR).

\- Shows all available monitor modes if > 2 present, in comma separated list.

\- Shows \fBEDID\fR errors and warnings if any present.

.TP
.B \-\-filter\fR, \fB\-z\fR
.br
See \fBFILTER OPTIONS\fR.

.TP
.B \-f \fR, \fB\-\-flags\fR
Show all CPU flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR 
in order to avoid spamming. ARM CPUs: show \fBfeatures\fR items.

.TP
.B \-F \fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters (except 
\fB\-J\fR and \fB\-W\fR) plus \fB\-\-swap\fR, \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-n\fR. Does not 
show extra verbose options such as \fB\-d \-f \-i -J \-l \-m \-o \-p \-r \-t \-u 
\-x\fR unless you use those arguments in the command, e.g.: 
\fBinxi \-Frmxx\fR

.TP
.B \-\-gpu\fR
Deprecated. See \fB\-G \-a\fR. 

.TP
.B \-G \fR, \fB\-\-graphics\fR
Show Graphic device(s) information, including details of device and display 
drivers (\fBX:\fR \fBloaded:\fR, and, if applicable: \fBunloaded:\fR, 
\fBfailed:\fR, \fBdri:\fR (if X and different from loaded X drivers) drivers, 
and active \fBgpu:\fR drivers), display protocol (if available), display server 
(and/or Wayland compositor), vendor and version number, e.g.:

\fBDisplay: x11 server: Xorg v: 1.15.1\fR

or:

\fBDisplay: wayland server: X.org v: 1.20.1 with: Xwayland v: 20.1\fR

If protocol is not detected, shows:

\fBDisplay: server: Xorg 1.15.1\fR

Adds \fBwith: Xwayland v:...\fR if xwayland server is installed, regardless of 
protocol. 

Also shows screen resolution(s) (per monitor/X screen). Shows graphics API used, 
like OpenGL. For X.org: OpenGL renderer, OpenGL core profile version/OpenGL 
version; for VESA: data (for Xvesa); for Wayland: GBM/EGL data (not 
implemented).

Compositor information will show if detected using \fB\-xx\fR option or always 
if detected and Wayland since the compositor is the server with Wayland.

\fB\-Gxx\fR shows monitor data as well, if detected. \fB\-\-edid\fR shows 
advanced monitor data (full modes, chroma, etc.).

.TP
.B \-h \fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set script 
global \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR if you want a different default value, or use 
\fB\-y [width]\fR to temporarily override the defaults or actual window width.

.TP
.B \-i \fR, \fB\-\-ip\fR
Show WAN IP address and local interfaces (latter requires \fBifconfig\fR or 
\fBip\fR network tool), as well as network output from \fB\-n\fR. Not shown with 
\fB\-F\fR for user security reasons. You shouldn't paste your local/WAN IP. 
Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP addresses.

.TP
.B \-I \fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, IRC client (or shell type if run 
in shell, not IRC), inxi version. See \fB\-Ix\fR, \fB\-Ixx\fR, and \fB\-Ia\fR
for extra information (init type/version, runlevel/target, packages). 

Note: if \fB\-m\fR or \fB\-tm\fR are active, the memory item will show in the 
main Memory: report of \fB\-m\fR/\fB\-tm\fR/, not in \fB\Info:\fR. 

See \fB\-m\fR for explanation of \fBMemory:\fR fields and values..

.TP
.B \-j\fR, \fB\-\-swap\fR
Shows all active swap types (partition, file, zram). When this option is used,
swap partition(s) will not show on the \fB\-P\fR line to avoid redundancy.

To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with 
\fB\-l\fR or\fB \-u\fR.

.TP
.B \-J \fR, \fB\-\-usb\fR
Show USB data for attached Hubs and Devices. Hubs also show number of ports. Be 
aware that a port is not always external, some may be internal, and either used 
or unused (for example, a motherboard USB header connector that is not used).

Hubs and Devices are listed in order of BusID.

BusID is generally in this format: BusID\-port[.port][.port]:DeviceID

Device ID is a number created by the kernel, and has no necessary ordering or 
sequence connection, but can be used to match this output to lsusb values, which 
generally shows BusID / DeviceID (except for tree view, which shows ports).

Examples: \fBDevice\-3: 4\-3.2.1:2\fR or \fBHub: 4\-0:1\fR

The \fBrev: 2.0\fR item refers to the USB revision number, like \fB1.0\fR or
\fB3.1\fR. 

Use \fB\-Jx\fR for basic Si base 10 bits/s speed, \fB\-Jxx\fR for Si and IEC 
base 2 Bytes/s speeds. \fB\-Ja\fR adds USB mode.

.TP
.B \-l \fR, \fB\-\-label\fR
Show partition labels. Use with \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, and \fB\-P\fR 
to show partition labels. Does nothing without one of those options.

Sample: \fB\-ojpl\fR.

.TP
.B \-L\fR, \fB\-\-logical\fR
Show Logical volume information, for LVM, LUKS, bcache, etc. Shows size, free 
space (for LVM VG). For LVM, shows \fBDevice\-[xx]: VG:\fR (Volume Group) 
size/free, \fBLV\-[xx]\fR (Logical Volume). LV shows type, size, and components. 
Note that components are made up of either containers (aka, logical devices), or 
physical devices. The full report requires doas/sudo/root.

Logical block devices can be thought of as devices that are made up out of 
either other logical devices, or physical devices. inxi does its best to show 
what each logical device is made out of. RAID devices form a subset of all 
possible Logical devices, but have their own section, \fB\-R\fR. 

If \fB\-R\fR is used with \fB\-Lxx\fR, \fB\-Lxx\fR will not show RAID 
information for LVM RAID devices since it's redundant. If \fB\-R\fR is not used, 
a simple RAID line will appear for LVM RAID in \fB\-Lxx\fR.

\fB\-Lxx\fR also shows all components and devices. Note that since components 
can go in many levels, each level per primary component is indicated by either 
another 'c', or ends with a 'p' device, the physical device. The number of c's 
or p's indicates the depth, so you can see which component belongs to which.

\fB\-L\fR shows only the top level components/devices (like \fB\-R\fR). 
\fB\-La\fR shows component/device size, maj:min ID, mapped name (if applicable), 
and puts each component/device on its own line.

Sample:

.nf
\fB  Device\-10: mybackup type: LUKS dm: dm\-28 size: 6.36 GiB Components: 
    c\-1: md1 cc\-1: dm\-26 ppp\-1: sdj2 cc\-2: dm\-27 ppp\-1: sdk2\fR
  \fBLV\-5: lvm_raid1 type: raid1 dm: dm\-16 size: 4.88 GiB 
    RAID: stripes: 2 sync: idle copied: 100% mismatches: 0 
  Components: c\-1: dm\-10 pp\-1: sdd1 c\-2: dm\-11 pp\-1: sdd1 c\-3: dm\-13 
    pp\-1: sde1 c\-4: dm\-15 pp\-1: sde1\fR
.fi

It is easier to follow the flow of components and devices using \fB\-y1\fR. In
this example, there is one primary component (c\-1), md1, which is made up of 
two components (cc\-1,2), dm\-26 and dm\-27. These are respectively made from 
physical devices (p\-1) sdj2 and sdk2.

.nf
\fBDevice\-10: mybackup
  maj\-min: 254:28
  type: LUKS
  dm: dm\-28
  size: 6.36 GiB
  Components: 
    c\-1: md1
    maj\-min: 9:1
    size: 6.37 GiB
    cc\-1: dm\-26
      maj\-min: 254:26
      mapped: vg5\-level1a
      size: 12.28 GiB
      ppp\-1: sdj2
        maj\-min: 8:146
        size: 12.79 GiB
    cc\-2: dm\-27
      maj\-min: 254:27
      mapped: vg5\-level1b
      size: 6.38 GiB
      ppp\-1: sdk2
        maj\-min: 8:162
        size: 12.79 GiB\fR
.fi

Other types of logical block handling like LUKS, bcache show as:

\fBDevice\-[xx] [name/id] type: [LUKS|Crypto|bcache]:\fR

.TP
.B \-m \fR, \fB\-\-memory\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Does not display with \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-F\fR unless you use 
\fB\-m\fR explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) 
(\fBArray\-[number]\fR), and individual memory devices (\fBDevice\-[number]\fR). 
Physical memory array data shows array capacity, number of devices supported, 
and Error Correction information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in 
syntax), type (eg: \fBtype: DDR3\fR)size, speed.

Note: \fB\-m\fR uses \fBdmidecode\fR, which must be run as root (or start 
\fBinxi\fR with \fBdoas/sudo\fR), unless you figure out how to set up doas/sudo 
to permit dmidecode to read \fB/dev/mem\fR as user. \fBspeed\fR and 
\fBbus\-width\fR will not show if \fBNo Module Installed\fR is found in 
\fBsize\fR.

Note: If \fB\-m\fR is triggered RAM available/used report will appear in this 
section, not in \fB\-I\fR or \fB\-tm\fR items.

Because \fBdmidecode\fR data is extremely unreliable, inxi will try to make 
best guesses. If you see \fB(check)\fR after the capacity number, you should 
check it with the specifications. \fB(est)\fR is slightly more reliable, but 
you should still check the real specifications before buying RAM. Unfortunately 
there is nothing \fBinxi\fR can do to get truly reliable data about the system 
RAM; maybe one day the kernel devs will put this data into \fB/sys\fR, and make 
it real data, taken from the actual system, not dmi data. For most people, the 
data will be right, but a significant percentage of users will have either a 
wrong max module size, if present, or max capacity.

Under dmidecode, \fBSpeed:\fR is the expected speed of the memory 
(what is advertised on the memory spec sheet) and \fBConfigured Clock Speed:\fR
is what the actual speed is now. To handle this, if speed and configured speed 
values are different, you will see this instead:

\fBspeed: spec: [specified speed] MT/s actual: [actual] MT/s\fR

Also, if DDR, and speed in MHz, will change to: \fBspeed: [speed] MT/s 
([speed] MHz)\fR

If the detected speed is logically absurd, like 1 MT/s or 69910 MT/s, adds: 
\fBnote: check\fR. Sample:

.nf
\fBMemory:
  System RAM: total: 32 GiB note: est. available: 31.38 GiB 
    used: 20.65 GiB (65.8%) 
  Array\-1: capacity: N/A slots: 4 note: check EC: N/A 
  Device\-1: DIMM_A1 type: DDR3 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device\-2: DIMM_A2 type: DDR3 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
    actual: 61910 MT/s (30955 MHz) note: check 
  Device\-3: DIMM_B1 type: DDR3 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device\-4: DIMM_B2 type: DDR3 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
    actual: 2 MT/s (1 MHz) note: check\fR

See \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR and \fB\-\-memory\-short\fR if you want a 
shorter report.

Notes on \fBSystem RAM:\fR / \fBMemory:\fR report item:

* \fBtotal:\fR and \fBigpu:\fR do not show for short form.

* The \fBtotal:\fR can come from several possible sources:

\- If not superuser, and if \fI/sys/devices/system/memory\fR exists, it will 
estimate the total RAM based on how many RAM blocks and their size. Sometimes 
the block count is not an exact match to installed RAM, and inxi will attempt to 
guess the actual RAM amount, except for virtual machines. When it synthesizes 
the actual physical RAM total, it will show \fBnote: est.\fR.

Note that not all kernels are compiled to support generating this /sys 
directory (kernel needs to be compiled with \fBCONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG\fR).

\- For OpenBSD and not superuser, the total comes from the detected RAM in 
dboot, if available.

\- If superuser, and if \fB\-m\fR used, it comes from the dmidecode RAM totals 
if available, and if not, it comes from counting up the System RAM ranges in 
\fI/proc/iomem\fR (Linux only), then rounding up, since that total is usually 
slightly under the actual physical RAM total. If inxi is unsure about the total, 
it will show \fBnote: est.\fB.

If no total data found, shows \fBtotal: N/A\fB.

* The \fBavailable:\fR item is the total installed RAM minus some reserved and 
kernel code RAM (and in some cases iGPU assigned main system RAM) that is 
allocated on system boot, and thus is generally less than the actual physical 
RAM installed. This is called MemTotal in free/meminfo even though it isn't, 
though it is the total available the kernel has to work with.

* The \fBused:\fR is the percent of the available RAM used, NOT of the total 
physical RAM.

* The \fBigpu:\fR item either comes from Raspberry Pi gpu RAM, or from 
\fI/proc/iomem\fR. The latter source is Linux + superuser only, and is not 
guaranteed to be accurate, but sometimes is. That is for iGPU system RAM used, 
not for standalone GPUs with their own internal RAM. Not all types of internal 
VRAM are detectable, it depends on how the hardware assigns RAM to iGPU.

Raspberry Pi uses \fBvcgencmd get_mem gpu\fR to get gpu RAM amount, if 
user is in video group and \fBvcgencmd\fR is installed. 

.TP
.B \-\-memory\-modules\fR, \fB\-\-mm\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Show only RAM arrays and modules in Memory report. 
Skip empty slots. See \fB\-m\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-memory\-short\fR, \fB\-\-ms\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Show a one line RAM report in Memory. See \fB\-m\fR.

Sample: \fBReport: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type: DDR4\fR

.TP
.B \-M \fR, \fB\-\-machine\fR
Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, BIOS, and if present, System Builder 
(Like Lenovo). Older systems/kernels without the required \fB/sys\fR data can 
use \fBdmidecode\fR instead, run as root. If using \fBdmidecode\fR, may also 
show BIOS/UEFI revision as well as version. \fB\-\-dmidecode\fR forces use of 
\fBdmidecode\fR data instead of \fB/sys\fR. Will also attempt to show if the 
system was booted by BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy], the latter being legacy 
BIOS boot mode in a system board using UEFI.

Device information requires either \fB/sys\fR or \fBdmidecode\fR. Note that 
\fBother\-vm?\fR is a type that means it's usually a VM, but inxi failed to 
detect which type, or positively confirm which VM it is. Primary VM 
identification is via systemd\-detect\-virt but fallback tests that should also 
support some BSDs are used. Less commonly used or harder to detect VMs may not 
be correctly detected. If you get an incorrect output, post an issue and we'll 
get it fixed if possible.

Due to unreliable vendor data, device type will show: desktop, laptop, 
notebook, server, blade, plus some obscure stuff that inxi is unlikely to 
ever run on.

.TP
.B \-n \fR, \fB\-\-network\-advanced\fR
Show Advanced Network device information in addition to that produced by 
\fB\-N\fR. Shows interface, speed, MAC ID, state, etc.

.br
Deprecated. See \fB\-Ga\fR.
    
.TP
.B \-o \fR, \fB\-\-unmounted\fR
Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).
Shows file system type if you have \fBlsblk\fR installed (Linux only). For 
BSD/GNU Linux: shows file system type if \fBfile\fR is installed, and if you 
are root or if you have added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

doas users: see \fBman doas.conf\fR for setup.

Does not show components (partitions that create the md\-raid array) of 
md\-raid arrays.

To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with 
\fB\-l\fR or\fB \-u\fR.

.TP
.B \-p \fR, \fB\-\-partitions\-full\fR
Show full Partition information (\fB\-P\fR plus all other detected mounted 
partitions).

To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with 
\fB\-l\fR or\fB \-u\fR.

.TP
.B \-P \fR, \fB\-\-partitions\fR
Show basic Partition information.
Shows, if detected: \fB/ /boot /boot/efi /home /opt /tmp /usr /usr/home /var 
/var/tmp /var/log\fR (for android, shows \fB/cache /data /firmware /system\fR). 
If \fB\-\-swap\fR is not used, shows active swap partitions (never shows file 
or zram type swap). Use \fB\-p\fR to see all mounted partitions.

To show partition labels or UUIDs (when available and relevant), use with 
\fB\-l\fR or\fB \-u\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-processes\fR
.br
See \fB\-t\fR.

.TP
.B \-r \fR, \fB\-\-repos\fR
Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

\fBAPK\fR (Alpine Linux + derived versions)

More will be added as distro data is collected. If yours is missing please
show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.

See \fB\-rx\fR, \fB\-rxx\fR, and \fB\-ra\fR for installed package count 
information.

.TP
.B \-R \fR, \fB\-\-raid\fR
Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, device/array size,
and components. See extra data with \fB\-x\fR / \fB\-xx\fR.

md\-raid: If device is resyncing, also shows resync progress line.

Note: supported types: lvm raid, md\-raid, softraid, ZFS, and hardware RAID. 
Other software RAID types may be added, if the software RAID can be made to 
give the required output.

The component ID numbers work like this: mdraid: the numerator is the actual 
mdraid component number; lvm/softraid/ZFS: the numerator is auto\-incremented 
counter only. Eg. \fBOnline: 1: sdb1\fR

If hardware RAID is detected, shows basic information. Due to complexity
of adding hardware RAID device disk / RAID reports, those will only be added 
if there is demand, and reasonable reporting tools. 

.TP
.B \-\-recommends\fR
Checks inxi application dependencies and recommends, as well as directories,
then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for each feature.

.TP
.B \-s \fR, \fB\-\-sensors\fR
Show output from sensors if sensors installed/configured: Motherboard/CPU/GPU 
temperatures; detected fan speeds. GPU temperature when available. Nvidia shows 
screen number for multiple screens. IPMI sensors are also used (root required) 
if present. 

See Advanced options \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR or \fB\-\-sensors\-exclude\fR if you 
want to use only a subset of all sensors, or exclude one (currently only for  
\fBlm\-sensors\fR and \fB/sys\fR sourced data).

For current Linux, will fallback gracefully to using \fB/sys/class/hwmon\fR as 
sensor data source if \fBlm\-sensors\fR is not installed. You can compare the 
two by using \fB\-\-force sensors\-sys\fR option with \fB\-s\fR.
.
.TP
.B \-\-slots\fR
Show PCI slots with type, speed, and status information.

.TP
.B \-\-swap\fR
.br
See \fB\-j\fR

.TP
.B \-S \fR, \fB\-\-system\fR
Show System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X),
distro. With \fB\-xx\fR show dm \- or startx \- (only shows if present and
running if out of X), and if in X, with \fB\-xxx\fR show more desktop info,
e.g. taskbar or panel.

.TP
.B \-t \fR, \fB\-\-processes\fR
[\fBc\fR|\fBm\fR|\fBcm\fR|\fBmc NUMBER\fR] Show processes. If no arguments, 
defaults to \fBcm\fR. If followed by a number, shows that number of processes 
for each type (default: \fB5\fR; if in IRC, max: \fB5\fR)

Make sure that there is no space between letters and numbers (e.g. write as 
\fB\-t cm10\fR).

.TP
.B \-t c\fR
\- CPU only. With \fB\-x\fR, also shows memory for that process on same line.

.TP
.B \-t m\fR
\- memory only. With \fB\-x\fR, also shows CPU for that process on same line.
If the \fB\-I\fR or \fB\-m\fR lines are not triggered, will also show the 
system RAM used/total information.

See \fB\-m\fR for explanation of \fBSystem RAM:\fR fields and values.

.TP
.B \-t cm\fR
\- CPU+memory. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also CPU or memory for that process on
same line.

.TP
.B \-u \fR, \fB\-\-uuid\fR
Show partition UUIDs. Use with \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, and \fB\-P\fR 
to show partition labels. Does nothing without one of those options.

Sample: \fB\-opju\fR.

.TP
.B \-U \fR, \fB\-\-update\fR
Note \- Maintainer may have disabled this function.

If inxi \fB\-h\fR has no listing for \fB\-U\fR then it's disabled.

Auto\-update script. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root to
update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this man page to:
\fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR (if \fB/usr/local/share/man/\fR exists
AND there is no inxi man page in \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR, otherwise it
goes to \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR). This requires that you be root to write
to that directory. See \fB\-\-man\fR or \fB\-\-no\-man\fR to force or disable 
man install.

.TP
.B \-\-usb\fR
.br
See \fB\-J\fR.

.TP
.B \-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
inxi full version and license information. Prints information then exits.

.TP
.B \-\-version\-short\fR, \fB\-\-vs\fR

(which shows version info already). Does not exit unless used without any other 
options. Can be used with normal line options.

.TP
.B \-v \fR, \fB\-\-verbosity\fR
Script verbosity levels. If no verbosity level number is given, 0 is assumed.
Should not be used with \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-F\fR.

Supported levels: \fB0\-8\fR Examples :\fB inxi \-v 4 \fR or \fB inxi \-v4\fR

.TP
.B \-v 0

min/max speeds, if available) + \fB\-G\fR + basic Disk + \fB\-I\fR.

.TP
.B \-v 2
\- Adds networking device (\fB\-N\fR), Machine (\fB\-M\fR) data, Battery 
(\fB\-B\fR) (if available). Same as: \fBinxi \-b\fR

.TP
.B \-v 3
\- Adds advanced CPU (\fB\-C\fR) and network (\fB\-n\fR) data; triggers 
\fB\-x\fR advanced data option.

.TP
.B \-v 4
\- Adds partition size/used data (\fB\-P\fR) for (if present): \fB/ /home /var/ 
/boot\fR. Shows full drive data (\fB\-D\fR)

.TP

\- Adds network IP data (\fB\-i\fR), forced bluetooth (\fB\-E\fR), Logical 
(\fB\-L\fR), RAID (\fB\-R\fR), full CPU flags/features (\fB\-f\fR),  triggers 
\fB\-xxx\fR

.TP
.B \-v 8

(\fB\-r\fR), PCI slots (\fB\-\-slots\fR), processes (\fB\-tcm\fR), admin 
(\fB\-\-admin\fR). Useful for testing output and to see what data you can get 
from your system.

.TP
.B \-w \fR, \fB\-\-weather\fR
Adds weather line. To get weather for an alternate location, use \fB\-W 
[location]\fR. See also \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR options. Please note 
that your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature.

DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! Automated or excessive 
use will lead to your being blocked from any further access. This feature is not 
meant for widget type weather monitoring, or Conky type use. It is meant to get 
weather when you need to see it, for example, on a remote server. If you did not
type the weather option in manually, it's an automated request. 

.TP
.B \-W\fR, \fB\-\-weather\-location [location_string]\fR
Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code[, country], 
city,state pair, or latitude,longitude. Note: city/country/state names must 
not contain spaces. Replace spaces with '\fB+\fR' sign. Don't place spaces 
around any commas. Postal code is not reliable except for North America and 
maybe the UK. Try postal codes with and without country code added. Note that 
City,State applies only to USA, otherwise it's City,Country. If country name 
(english) does not work, try 2 character country code (e.g. Spain: es; 
Great Britain: gb). 

See \fIhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166\-1_alpha\-2\fR for current 2 
letter country codes.

Use only ASCII letters in city/state/country names.

Examples: \fB\-W 95623,us\fR OR \fB\-W Boston,MA\fR OR 
\fB\-W 45.5234,\-122.6762\fR OR \fB\-W new+york,ny\fR OR \fB\-W bodo,norway\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-weather\-source\fR, \fB\-\-ws [unit]\fR
[\fB1\-9\fR] Switches weather data source. Possible values are \fB1\-9\fR. 
\fB1\-4\fR will generally be active, and \fB5\-9\fR may or may not be active, 
so check. \fB1\fR may not support city / country names with spaces (even if 
you use the \fB+\fR sign instead of space). \fB2\fR offers pretty good data, 
but may not have all small city names for \fB\-W\fR. 

Please note that the data sources are not static per value, and can change any 
time, or be removed, so always test to verify which source is being used for 
each value if that is important to you. Data sources may be added or removed 
on occasions, so try each one and see which you prefer. If you get unsupported 
source message, it means that number has not been implemented.

.TP
.B \-\-weather\-unit [unit]\fR
[\fBm\fR|\fBi\fR|\fBmi\fR|\fBim\fR] Sets weather units to metric (\fBm\fR), 
imperial (\fBi\fR), metric (imperial) (\fBmi\fR, default), imperial (metric) 
(\fBim\fR). If metric or imperial not found,sets to default value, or \fBN/A\fR.

.SH FILTER OPTIONS
The following options allow for applying various types of filtering to the 
output.

.TP
.B \-\-filter \fR, \fB\-\-filter\-override\fR
.br
See \fB\-z\fR, \fB\-Z\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-filter\-label\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-uuid\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-vulnerabilities\fR
.br
See \fB\-\-zl\fR, \fB\-\-zu\fR, \fB\-\-zv\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-host\fR
Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set):

\fBSHOW_HOST='false'\fR \- Same as: \fBSHOW_HOST='true'\fR

This is an absolute override, the host will always show no matter what
other switches you use.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-host\fR
Turns off hostname in System line. This is default when using \fB\-z\fR,
for anonymizing inxi output for posting on forums or IRC. Overrides
configuration value (if set):

\fBSHOW_HOST='true'\fR \- Same as: \fBSHOW_HOST='false'\fR

This is an absolute override, the host will not show no matter what other 
switches you use.

.TP
.B \-z\fR, \fB\-\-filter\fR
Adds security filters for IP addresses, serial numbers, MAC, location 
(\fB\-w\fR), and user home directory name. Removes Host:. On by default for IRC 
clients.

.TP
.B \-\-za\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-all\fR
Shortcut to trigger \fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zl\fR, \fB\-\-zu\fR, \fB\-\-zv\fR. All the
filters, that is.

.TP
.B \-\-zl\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-label\fR
Filter partition label names from \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-P\fR, 
and \fB\-Sa\fR (root=LABEL=...). Generally only useful in very specialized 
cases.

.TP
.B \-\-zu\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-uuid\fR
Filter partition UUIDs from \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-P\fR, and 
\fB\-Sa\fR (root=UUID=...). Generally only useful in very specialized cases.

.TP
.B \-\-zv\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-v\fR, \fB\-\-filter\-vulnerabilities\fR 
Filter Vulnerabilities report from \fB\-Ca\fR. Generally only useful in very 
specialized cases.

.TP
.B \-Z \fR, \fB\-\-filter\-override \fR, \fB\-\-no\-filter\fR 
Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking
issues in IRC for example.

.SH OUTPUT CONTROL OPTIONS
The following options allow for modifying the output in various ways.

.TP
.B \-c \fR, \fB\-\-color\fR \fR[\fB0\fR\-\fB42\fR]
Set color scheme. If no scheme number is supplied, 0 is assumed.

.TP
.B \-c \fR[\fB94\fR\-\fB99\fR]
These color selectors run a color selector option prior to inxi starting 
which lets you set the config file value for the selection.

NOTE: All configuration file set color values are removed when output is 
piped or redirected. You must use the explicit runtime \fB\-c [color number]\fR 
option if you want color codes to be present in the piped/redirected output.

Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: IRC and global only show safe 
color set):

.TP
.B \-c 94\fR
\- Console, out of X.

.TP
.B \-c 95\fR
\- Terminal, running in X \- like xTerm.

.TP
.B \-c 96\fR
\- GUI IRC, running in X \- like XChat, Quassel,
Konversation etc.

.TP
.B \-c 97\fR
\- Console IRC running in X \- like irssi in xTerm.

.TP
.B \-c 98\fR
\- Console IRC not in X.

.TP
.B \-c 99\fR
\- Global \- Overrides/removes all settings.

Setting a specific color type removes the global color selection.

.TP
.B \-\-export [json|screen|xml]\fR
.br
See \fB\-\-output\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-indent [11\-xx]\fR
Change primary wide indent width. Generally useless. Only applied if output 
width is greater than max wrap width (see \fB\-\-max\-wrap\fR). Use 
configuration item \fBINDENT\fR to make permanent.

.TP
.B \-\-indents [0\-10]\fR
Change primary wrap mode, second, and \fB\-y1\fR level indents. First indent 
level only applied if output width is less than max wrap width (see 
\fB\-\-max\-wrap\fR). 0 disables all wrapped indents and all second level 
indents. Use configuration item \fBINDENTS\fR to make permanent.

.TP
.B \-\-limit [\-1 \- x]\fR
Raise or lower max output limit of IP addresses for \fB\-i\fR. \fB\-1\fR 
removes limit.

.TP
.B \-\-max\-wrap\fR, \fB\-\-wrap\-max [integer]\fR
Overrides default or configuration set line starter wrap width value. Wrap max 
is the maximum width that inxi will wrap line starters (e.g. \fBInfo:\fR) to 
their own lines, with data lines indented default 2 columns (use 
\fB\-\-indents\fR to change). 

If terminal/console width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than wrap width, wrapping 
of line starter occurs. If \fB80\fR or less, no wrapping will occur. Overrides 
internal default value (110) and user configuration value \fBMAX_WRAP\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-output\fR, \fB \-\-export [json|screen|xml]\fR
Change data output type. Requires \-\-output\-file if not \fBscreen\fR.

See this page \fIhttps://smxi.org/docs/inxi-json-xml-output.htm\fR BEFORE you 
post an issue about not understanding, or being unable to use, the output 
format! That gives a fairly complete explanation of what the output means, and 
how to work with it. It is not a tutorial, and it will not teach you to program, 
if you don't know how to work with json/xml structures using a proper language, 
then this feature is not meant for you.

.TP
.B \-\-output\-file, \fB \-\-export\-file [full path to output file|print]\fR
The given directory path must exist. The directory path given must exist,
The \fBprint\fR options prints to stdout.
Required for non\-screen \fB\-\-output\fR formats (json|xml).

.TP
.B \-\-partition\-sort [dev\-base|fs|id|label|percent\-used|size|uuid|used]\fR
Change default sort order of partition output. Corresponds to 
\fBPARTITION_SORT\fR configuration item. These are the available sort options:

\fBdev\-base\fR - \fB/dev\fR partition identifier, like \fB/dev/sda1\fR. 
Note that it's an alphabetic sort, so \fBsda12\fR is before \fBsda2\fR.

\fBfs\fR \- Partition filesystem. Note that sorts will be somewhat random if 
all filesystems are the same.

\fBid\fR \- Mount point of partition (default).

\fBlabel\fR \- Label of partition. If partitions have no labels, 
sort will be random.

\fBpercent\-used\fR - Percentage of partition size used.

\fBsize\fR \- KiB size of partition.

\fBuuid\fR \- UUID of the partition.

\fBused\fR \- KiB used of partition.

.TP
.B \-\-separator\fR, \fB\-\-sep [character(s)]\fR
Change the default output key: value separator \fB:\fR to something else. Make
permanent with configuration item \fBSEP2_CONSOLE\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-wrap\-max [integer]\fR
.br
See \fB\-\-max-wrap\fR.

.TP
.B \-y\fR, \fB\-\-width [integer]\fR
This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max. 
Overrides \fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR, \fBCOLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY\fR, \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR 
configuration items, or the actual widths of the terminal. 

* \fB\-y\fR \- sets default width of 80 columns.
.br
* \fB\-y [60-xxx]\fR \- sets width to given number. Must be 60 or more.
.br
* \fB\-y 1\fR \-  switches to a single indented key/value pair per line, and 
removes all long line wrapping (similar to \fBdmidecode\fR output). Not 
recommended for use with \fB\-Y\fR;
.br
* \fB\-y \-1\fR \- removes width limits (if assigned by configuration items). 

Examples:
.br
\fBinxi \-Fxx \-y 130\fR
.br
\fBinxi \-Fxxy\fR
.br
\fBinxi \-bay1\fR

.TP
.B \-Y\fR, \fB\-\-height\fR, \fB\-\-less [\-3\-[integer]\fR
Control output height. Useful when in console, and scrollback not available.
Breaks output flow based on values provided. 

* \fB\-Y 0\fR or \fB\-Y\fR \- Set default max height to terminal height.
.br
* \fB\-Y [1\-xxx]\fR \- set max output block height height in lines.
.br
* \fB\-Y \-1\fR \- Print out one primary data item block (like \fBCPU:\fR, 
\fBSystem:\fR) at a time. Useful for very long outputs like \fB\-Fa\fR, 
\fB\-v8\fR, etc. Not available for \fB\-h\fR.
.br
* \fB\-Y \-2\fR \- Do not disable output colors when redirected or piped to 
another program. Useful if piping output to \fBless \-R\fR for example. This
does not limit the height otherwise since the expectation it is being piped to
another program like \fBless\fR which will handle that.
.br
* \fB\-Y \-3\fR \- Restore default unlimited output lines if \fBLINES_MAX\fR 
configuration item set.

Recommended to use the following for very clean up and down scrollable output 
out of display, while retaining the color schemes, which are normally removed 
with piping or redirect:

\fBpinxi \-v8Y \-2 | less \-R\fR

Note: since it's not possible for inxi to know how many actual terminal lines 
are being used by terminal wrapped output, with \fB\-y 1\fR , it may be better 
in general to use a fixed height like:

\fB\-y 1 \-Y 20\fR instead of: \fB\-y 1 \-Y\fR

.SH EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options can be triggered by one or more \fB\-x\fR.
Alternatively, the \fB\-v\fR options trigger them in the following
way: \fB\-v 3\fR adds \fB\-x\fR;
\fB\-v 6\fR adds \fB\-xx\fR; \fB\-v 7\fR adds \fB\-xxx\fR

These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in\-depth
data on various options. They can be added to any long form option list,
e.g.: \fB\-bxx\fR or \fB\-Sxxx\fR

There are 3 extra data levels:
.br
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR
.br
OR
.br
\fB\-\-extra 1\fR, \fB\-\-extra 2\fR, \fB\-\-extra 3\fR

The following details show which lines / items display extra information for
each extra data level.

.TP
.B \-x \-A\fR
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows specific 
vendor [product] information.

\- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each device.

\- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

\- Adds inactive sound servers/APIs, if detected.

.TP
.B \-x \-B\fR
\- Adds vendor/model, battery status (if battery present).

\- Adds attached battery powered peripherals (\fBDevice\-[number]:\fR) if 
detected (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

\- Adds battery \fBvolts:\fR, \fBmin:\fR voltages. Note that if difference is 
critical, that is current voltage is too close to minimum voltage, shows without 
\fB\-x\fR.

.TP
.B \-x \-C\fR
\- Adds bogomips to CPU speed report (if available).

\- Adds \fBL1:\fR and \fBL3:\fR cache types if either are present/available. For 
BSD or legacy Linux, uses dmidecode + doas/sudo/root. Force use of dmidecode 
cache values by adding \fB\-\-dmidecode\fR. This will override /sys based cache
data, which tends to be better, so in general don't do that.

\- Adds \fBboost: [enabled|disabled]\fR if detected, aka \fBturbo\fR. Not all 
CPUs have this feature.

\- Adds CPU Flags (short list). Use \fB\-f\fR to see full flag/feature list.

\- Adds CPU microarchitecture + revision (e.g. Sandy Bridge, K8, ARMv8, P6, 
etc.). Only shows data if detected. Newer microarchitectures will have to be 
added as they appear, and require the CPU family ID, model ID, and stepping.

\- Adds, if smt (Simultaneous MultiThreading) is available but disabled, after 
\fBtype:\fR data \fBsmt: disabled\fR. \fBtype: MT\fR means it's enabled. See 
\fB\-Cxxx\fR.

Examples: 
.br
\fBarch: Sandy Bridge rev: 2\fR
.br
\fBarch: K8 rev.F+ rev: 2\fR

If unable to non\-ambiguosly determine architecture, will show something like:
\fBarch: Amber Lake note: check rev: 9\fR

\- Adds CPU highest speed after \fBavg: [speed] high: [speed]\fR if greater than 
1 core and cores have different speeds. Linux only.

.TP
.B \-x \-d\fR
\- Adds more items to \fBFeatures\fR line of optical drive; 
dds rev version to optical drive.

.TP
.B \-x \-D\fR
\- Adds drive temperature with disk data.

Method 1: Systems running Linux kernels ~5.6 and newer should have 
\fBdrivetemp\fR module data available. If so, drive temps will come from 
/sys data for each drive, and will not require root or hddtemp. This method 
is MUCH faster than using hddtemp. Note that NVMe drives do not require 
\fBdrivetemp\fR.

If your \fBdrivetemp\fR module is not enabled, enable it:

\fBmodprobe drivetemp\fR

Once enabled, add \fBdrivetemp\fR to \fB/etc/modules\fR or 
\fB/etc/modules\-load.d/***.conf\fR so it starts automatically. 

If you see drive temps running as regular user and you did not configure system 
to use doas/sudo hddtemp, then your system supports this feature. If no /sys 
data is found, inxi will try to use hddtemp methods instead for that drive. 
Hint: if temp is /sys sourced, the temp will be to 1 decimal, like 34.8, if 
hddtemp sourced, they will be integers.

Method 2: if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root
or if you have added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp (sample)

doas users: see \fBman doas.conf\fR for setup.

You can force use of \fBhddtemp\fR for all drives using \fB\-\-hddtemp\fR. 

\- If free LVM volume group size detected (root required), show \fBlvm\-free:\fR
on Local Storage line. This is how much unused space the VGs contain, that is,
space not assigned to LVs.

.TP
.B \-x \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- Adds PCI/USB Bus ID of each device.

\- Adds driver version (if available) for each device.

\- Adds (if available, and \fBhciconfig\fR only) LMP (HCI if no LMP data, 
and HCI if HCI/LMP versions are different) version (if available) 
for each HCI ID.

.TP
.B \-x \-G\fR
\- Adds GPU micro\-architecture (if AMD/Intel/Nvidia and detected).

\- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- \fBX.org:\fR Adds direct rendering status.

\- \fBX.org:\fR Adds (for single GPU, nvidia driver) screen number that GPU is 
running on.

\- Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

.TP
.B \-x \-i\fR
\- Adds IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for
each interface.

Note that there is no way we are aware of to filter out the deprecated
IP v6 scope site/global temporary addresses from the output of
\fBifconfig\fR. The \fBip\fR tool shows that clearly.

\fBip\-v6\-temporary\fR \- (\fBip\fR tool only), scope global temporary.
Scope global temporary deprecated is not shown

\fBip\-v6\-global\fR \- scope global (\fBifconfig\fR will show this for
all types, global, global temporary, and global temporary deprecated,
\fBip\fR shows it only for global)

\fBip\-v6\-link\fR \- scope link (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR) \- default
for \fB\-i\fR.

\fBip\-v6\-site\fR \- scope site (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR). This has been
deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. \fBifconfig\fR may show multiple site
values, as with global temporary, and global temporary deprecated.

\fBip\-v6\-unknown\fR \- unknown scope

.TP
.B \-x \-I\fR
\- Adds current init system (and init rc in some cases, like OpenRC).
With \fB\-xx\fR, shows init/rc version number, if available.

\- Adds default system gcc. With \fB\-xx\fR, also show other installed gcc
versions.

\- Adds current runlevel/target (not available with all init systems).

\- Adds total packages discovered in system. See \fB\-xx\fR and \fB\-a\fR
for per package manager types output. Moves to \fBRepos\fR if \fB\-rx\fR.

If your package manager is not supported, please file an issue and we'll add it. 
That requires the full output of the query or method to discover all installed 
packages on your system, as well of course as the command or method used to 
discover those.

\- If in shell (i.e. not in IRC client), adds shell version number, if 
available.

.TP
.B \-x \-j\fR (\fB\-\-swap\fR)
Add \fBmapper:\fR. See \fB\-x \-o\fR.

.TP
.B \-x \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- For Devices, adds driver(s).

\- Adds, if available, USB speed in base 10 bits/s (Si) units \fBMb/s\fR or 
\fBGb/s\fR (may be incorrect on BSDs due to non reliable data source). These are 
base 10 bits per second. This unit corresponds to the standard units the USB 
consortium uses to indicate speeds, but not to how most of the rest of your 
system reports sizes. Use \fB\-Jxx\fR to add base 2 IEC Byte/second speeds.

.TP
.B \-x \-L\fR (\fB\-\-logical\fR)
\- Adds \fBdm: dm-x\fR to VG > LV and other Device types. This can help 
tracking down which device belongs to what.

.TP
.B \-x \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- If present, adds maximum memory module/device size in the Array line.
Only some systems will have this data available. Shows estimate if it can
generate one.

.TP
.B \-x \-N\fR
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each device;

\- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

\- Adds device temperature for each discrete device (Linux only).

.TP
.B \-x \-o\fR, \fB\-x \-p\fR, \fB\-x \-P\fR
\- Adds \fBmapper:\fR (the \fB/dev/mapper/\fR partition ID) 
if mapped partition. 

Example: \fBID\-4: /home ... dev: /dev/dm-6 mapped: ar0-home\fR

.TP
.B \-x \-r\fR
\- Adds Package info. See \fB\-Ix\fR

.TP
.B \-x \-R\fR
\- md\-raid: Adds second RAID Info line with extra data: blocks, chunk size,
bitmap (if present). Resync line, shows blocks synced/total blocks.

\- Hardware RAID: Adds driver version, Bus ID.

.TP
.B \-x \-s\fR
\- Adds basic voltages: 12v, 5v, 3.3v, vbat (\fBipmi\fR, \fBlm\-sensors / 
/sys/class/hwmon\fR if present).

.TP
.B \-x \-S\fR
\- Adds Kernel gcc version.

\- Adds to \fBDistro:\fR \fBbase:\fR if detected. System base will only be 
seen on a subset of distributions. The distro must be both derived from a 
parent distro (e.g. Mint from Ubuntu), and explicitly added to the supported 
distributions for this feature. Due to the complexity of distribution 
identification, these will only be added as relatively solid methods are 
found for each distribution system base detection.

.TP
.B \-x \-\-slots\fR
\- Adds slot \fBbus\-ID:\fR, if found. 

.TP
.B \-x \-t\fR (\fB\-\-processes\fR)
\- Adds memory use output to CPU (\fB\-xt c\fR), and CPU use to memory
(\fB\-xt m\fR).

.TP
.B \-x \-w \fR, \fB\-W\fR
\- Adds humidity and barometric pressure.

\- Adds wind speed and direction.

.TP
.B \-xx \-A\fR
\- Adds vendor:product ID for each device.

\- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, if detected).

\- Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

\- Adds \fBwith: [item] \fBstatus: [state/plugin]\fR helper daemons/plugins for
the sound API/server. 

.TP
.B \-xx \-B\fR
\- Adds current power use, in watts.

\- Adds serial number.

.TP
.B \-xx \-D\fR
\- Adds HDD/SSD drive serial number.

\- Adds drive speed (if available). This is the theoretical top speed of the 
device as reported. This speed may be restricted by system board limits, 
eg. a SATA 3 drive on a SATA 2 board may report SATA 2 speeds, but this is 
not completely consistent, sometimes a SATA 3 device on a SATA 2 board reports 
its design speed.

NVMe drives: adds lanes, and (per direction) speed is calculated with 
lane speed * lanes * PCIe overhead. PCIe 1 and 2 have data rates of 
GT/s * .8 = Gb/s (10 bits required to transfer 8 bits of data). 
PCIe 3 and greater transfer data at a rate of GT/s * 128/130 * lanes = Gb/s 
(130 bits required to transfer 128 bits of data).

For a PCIe 3 NVMe drive, with speed of \fB8 GT/s\fR and \fB4\fR lanes 
(\fB8GT/s * 128/130 * 4 = 31.6 Gb/s\fR): 

\fBspeed: 31.6 Gb/s lanes: 4\fR

\- Adds HDD/SSD drive duid, if available. Some BSDs have it.

\- Adds for USB drives USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

.TP
.B \-xx \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

\- Adds (\fBhciconfig \fRonly) LMP subversion (and/or HCI revision 
if applicable) for each device.

\- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe bluetooth, which is 
rare).

\- Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

.TP
.B \-xx \-G\fR
Triggers much more complete Screen/Monitor output. 

\fBX.org:\fR requires \fBxdpyinfo\fR or \fBxrandr\fR, and the advanced per 
monitor feature requires \fBxrandr\fR. 

\fBWayland:\fR requires any tool capable of showing monitor and resolution 
information. \fBSway\fR has \fBswaymsg\fR, \fBweston\-info\fR or 
\fBwayland\-info\fR can show Wayland information on any Wayland compositor, and 
\fBwlr\-randr\fR can show Wayland information for any \fBwlroots\fR based 
compositor.

Further note that all references to \fBDisplays\fR, \fBScreens\fR, and 
\fBMonitors\fR are referring to the \fBX\fR or \fBWayland\fR technical terms, 
not normal consumer usage. 

\fBX.org:\fR 1 \fBDisplay\fR runs 1 or more \fBScreens\fR, and 1 \fBScreen\fR 
runs 1 or more \fBMonitors\fR.

\fBWayland:\fR The \fBDisplay\fR is the primary container, and it can contain 1 
or more \fBMonitors\fR.

\- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

\- Adds PCIe speed and lanes item (Linux only, and if PCIe device and detected).

\- Adds for USB devices USB rev, speed, lanes (lanes Linux only).

\- Adds output port IDs, active, off (connected but disabled, like a closed 
laptop lid) and empty. Example:

\fBports: active: DVI\-I\-1,VGA\-1 empty: HDMI\-A\-1\fR

\- Adds \fBDisplay\fR ID. X.org: the Display running the Screen that runs the 
Monitors; Wayland: the Display that runs the monitors.

\- Adds compositor, if found (always shows for Wayland).

\- \fBWayland:\fR Adds to  \fBDisplay\fR \fBd-rect:\fR if > 1 monitors in 
Display. This is the size of the rectangle Wayland creates to situate the 
monitors in.

\- \fBX.org:\fR If available, shows \fBalternate:\fR Xorg drivers. This means a 
driver on the default list of drivers Xorg automatically checks for the device, 
but which is not installed. For example, if you have \fBnouveau\fR driver, 
\fBnvidia\fR would show as alternate if it was not installed. Note that 
\fBalternate:\fR does NOT mean you should have it, it's just one of the drivers 
Xorg checks to see if is present and loaded when checking the device. This can 
let you know there are other driver options. Note that if you have explicitly 
set the driver in \fBxorg.conf\fR, Xorg will not create this automatic check 
driver list.

\- \fBXorg:\fR Adds total number of \fBScreens\fR listed for the current 
\fBDisplay\fR.

\- \fBXorg:\fR Adds default \fBScreen\fR ID if Screen (not monitor!) total is 
greater than 1.

\- \fBX.org:\fR Adds \fBScreen\fR line, which includes the ID (\fBScreen: 0\fR) 
then \fBs-res\fR (Screen resolution), \fBs\-dpi\fR. Remember, this is an Xorg 
\fBScreen\fR, NOT a monitor screen, and the information listed is about the Xorg 
Screen! It may at times be the same as a single monitor system, but usually it's 
different in some ways. Note that the physical monitor dpi and the Xorg dpi are 
not necessarily the same thing, and can vary widely.

\- Adds \fBMonitor\fR lines. Monitors are a subset of a \fBScreen\fR (X.org) or 
\fBDisplay\fR (Wayland), each of which can have one or more monitors. Normally a 
dual monitor setup is 2 monitors run by one Xorg Screen/Wayland Display. 

\- \fBpos: [primary,]{position string|row\-col}\fR (X.org: requires 
\fBxrandr\fR; Wayland: requires \fBswaymsg\fR [sway], \fBwlr\-randr\fR [wlroots 
based compositors], \fBweston\-info\fR / \fBwayland\-info\fR [all]). Uses either 
explicit \fBprimary\fR value or +0+0 position if no primary monitor value set. 
\fBpos:\fR does not show for single monitor setups, or if no position data was 
found.

Position is text (left, center, center-l, center\-r, right, top, top\-left, 
top\-center, top\-right, middle, middle\-c, middle\-r, bottom, bottom\-l, 
bottom\-c, bottom\-r) if monitors fit within the following grids: 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 
2x1, 2x2, 2x3, 3x1, 3x2, 3x3. If layout not supported in text, uses 
[row\-nu]\-[column\-nu] instead to indicate the monitor's position in its grid.

The position is based on the upper left corner of each monitor relative to the 
grid of monitors that the \fBXorg\fR \fBScreen\fR is composed of.

\- \fBdiag:\fR monitor screen diagonal in mm (inches). Note that this is the 
real monitor size, not the Xorg full Screen diagonal size, which can be quite 
different. 

\- For free drivers, adds OpenGL compatibility version number if available. For 
nonfree drivers, the core version and compatibility versions are usually the 
same. Example:

\fBv: 3.3 Mesa 11.2.0 compat\-v: 3.0\fR

.TP
.B \-xx \-I\fR
\- Adds init type version number (and rc if present).

\- Adds other detected installed gcc versions (if present).

\- Adds system default runlevel/target, if detected. Supports Systemd / Upstart 
/SysVinit type defaults.

\- Shows \fBPackages:\fR counts by discovered package manager types (\fBpm:\fR). 
In cases where only 1 pm had results, does not show total after \fBPackages:\fR. 
Does not show installed package managers with 0 packages. See \fB\-a\fR for full 
output. Moves to \fBRepos\fR if \fB\-rxx\fR.

\- Adds parent program (or pty/tty) that started shell, if not IRC client.

.TP
.B \-xx \-j\fR (\fB\-\-swap\fR), \fB\-xx \-p\fR, \fB\-xx \-P\fR
\- Adds swap priority to each swap partition (for \fB\-P\fR) used, and for all
swap types (for \fB\-j\fR).

.TP
.B \-xx \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- Adds vendor:chip id.

\- Adds USB lanes. Uses tx (transmit) lane count for total unless rx and tx 
counts are different (eg: \fBlanes: rx: 2 tx: 4\fR). Linux only.
See \fB\-Ja\fR for sample output.

.TP
.B \-xx \-L\fR (\fB\-\-logical\fR)
\- Adds internal LVM Logical volumes, like raid image and meta data volumes. 

\- Adds full list of Components, sub\-components, and their physical devices.

\- For LVM RAID, adds a RAID report line (if not \fB\-R\fR). Read up on LVM
documentation to better understand their use of the term 'stripes'.

.TP
.B \-xx \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- Adds memory device Manufacturer.

\- Adds memory device Part Number (\fBpart\-no:\fR). Useful for ordering new 
or replacement memory sticks etc. Part numbers are unique, particularly if you 
use the word \fBmemory\fR in the search as well. With \fB\-xxx\fR, also shows 
serial number.

\- Adds single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may not be 
100% right all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found
in \fBdmidecode\fR output for \fBtype 6\fR and \fBtype 17\fR.

\- Adds, if present, memory array voltage. Only some legacy systems will have 
this data available.

\- Adds memory module current configured operating voltage, if available.

.TP
.B \-xx \-M\fR
\- Adds chassis information, if data is available. Also shows BIOS
ROM size if using \fBdmidecode\fR.

Supports most known display managers, including gdm, gdm3,
idm, kdm, lightdm, lxdm, mdm, nodm, sddm, slim, tint, wdm, and xdm.

\- Adds, if run in X, window manager type (\fBwm\fR), if available. Not all 
window managers are supported. Some desktops support using more than one 
window manager, so this can be useful to see what window manager is actually 
running. If none found, shows nothing. Uses a less accurate fallback tool 
\fBwmctrl\fR if \fBps\fR tests fail to find data.

\- Adds desktop toolkit (\fBtk\fR), if available (Xfce/KDE/Trinity).

.TP
.B \-xx \-\-slots\fR
\- Adds slot length.

\- Adds slot voltage, if available.

.TP
.B \-xx \-w \fR, \fB\-W\fR

.TP
.B \-xxx \-B\fR
\- Adds battery chemistry (e.g. \fBLi\-ion\fR), cycles (NOTE: there appears to
be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the cycle count, so this almost
always shows \fB0\fR. There's nothing that can be done about this glitch, the
data is simply not available as of 2018\-04\-03), location (only available from
\fBdmidecode\fR derived output).

\- Adds attached device \fBrechargeable: [yes|no]\fR information. 

.TP
.B \-xxx \-C\fR
\- Adds CPU voltage and external clock speed (this is the motherboard speed). 
Requires doas/sudo/root and \fBdmidecode\fR.

\fBtype:\fR data \fBsmt: [status]\fR.
.br
\fBsmt: [status]\fR
.br
\fBMT\fR in \fBtype:\fR will show if smt is enabled in general. 3 values are 
possible: [\fBenabled|disabled|<unsupported>\fR]. \fB<unsupported>\fR means the 
CPU does not support SMT.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-D\fR
\- Adds HDD/SSD drive firmware revision number (if available).

\- Adds drive partition scheme (in most cases), e.g. \fBscheme: GPT\fR. 
Currently not able to detect all schemes, but handles the most common, e.g. 
\fBGPT\fR or \fBMBR\fR.

\- Adds drive tech (\fBHDD\fR/\fBSSD\fR), rotation speed (in some but not all 
cases), e.g. \fBtech: HDD rpm: 7200\fR, or \fBtech: SSD\fR if positive SSD 
identification was made. If no HDD, rotation, or positive SSD ID found, shows 
\fBtech: N/A\fR. Not all HDD spinning disks report their speed, so even if they 
are spinning, no rpm data will show.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

\- Adds (\fBhciconfig \fRonly) HCI version, revision.

.TP

\- Adds to Device \fBserial:\fR number (if found).

\- \fBXorg:\fR Adds to \fBScreen:\fR \fBs\-size:\fR and \fBs\-diag:\fR. (Screen 
size data requires \fBxdpyinfo\fR). This is the X.org Screen dimensions, NOT the 
Monitor size!

\- Adds to Monitors (if detected) frequency (\fBhz:\fR).

\- Adds to Monitors (if detected) size (\fBsize: 277x156mm (10.9x6.1")\fR). Note 
that this is the real physical monitor size, not the Xorg Screen/Wayland Display 
size, which can be quite different (1 Xorg Screen / Wayland Display can for 
instance contain two or more monitors). 

\- Adds to Monitors \fBmodes: min: max:\fR (if detected). These are the smallest 
and largest monitor modes found, using an inexact method, so might not always be 
right.

\- Adds to Monitors \fBserial:\fR number (if detected).

\- \fBWayland:\fR Adds to Monitors \fBscale:\fR (if detected).

.TP
.B \-xxx \-I\fR
\- For \fBUptime:\fR adds \fBwakeups:\fR to show how many times the machine
has been woken from suspend state during current uptime period (if available,
Linux only). 0 value means the machine has not been suspended. 

\- For \fBShell:\fR adds \fB(su|sudo|login)\fR to shell name if present.

\- For \fBShell:\fR adds \fBdefault:\fR shell if different from
running shell, and default shell \fBv:\fR, if available.

\- For \fBrunning\-in:\fR adds \fB(SSH)\fR to parent, if present. SSH detection
uses the \fBwhoami\fR test.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- Adds, if present, serial number for non hub devices.

\- Adds \fBinterfaces:\fR for non hub devices.

\- Adds, if present, USB class ID.

\- Adds, if non 0, max power in mA.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- Adds memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. e.g.

\fBwidth (bits): data: 64 total: 72\fR

Note that total / data widths are mixed up sometimes in dmidecode output, so 
inxi will take the larger value as the total if present. \fBData\fR width 
usually corresponds to the CPU bits. \fBTotal\fR can reflect EEC or Dual Channel 
widths. If no total width data is found, shows:

\fBwidth: N/A\fR

\- Adds device type detail, e.g. \fBtype: DDR3 detail: Synchronous\fR.

\- Adds device serial number.

\- Adds memory module current, max, and min voltages, if they are available and

\- Adds (if present), window manager (\fBwm\fR) version number.

\- Adds (if present), display manager (\fBdm\fR) version number.

\- Adds (if available, and in display), virtual terminal (\fBvt\fR) number.
These are the same as \fBctrl+alt+F[x]\fR numbers usually. Some systems
have this, some don't, it varies.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-w \fR, \fB\-W\fR
\- Adds location (city state country), observation altitude (if available), 
weather observation time (if available), sunset/sunrise (if available).

.SH ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options are triggered with \fB\-\-admin\fR or \fB\-a\fR. Admin options 
are advanced output options, and are more technical, and mostly of interest to 
system administrators or other machine admins. 

The \fB\-\-admin\fR option sets \fB\-xxx\fR, and only has to be used once.
It will trigger the following features:

.TP
.B \-a \-A\fR
\- Adds, if present, possible \fBalternate:\fR kernel modules capable of 
driving each \fBDevice\-x\fR (not including the current \fBdriver:\fR). If no 
non\-driver modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module 
does NOT mean it is available in the system, it's just something the kernel 
knows could possibly be used instead. 

\- Adds PCIe generation, and, if different than running PCIe generation, speed 
or lanes, \fBlink\-max: gen: speed: lanes:\fR (only items different from primary 
shown).

\- Adds list of detected audio server tools (\fBtools: [tools]\fR) to API/Server 
lines, like alsamixer, jack_control, pactl, pavuctl, pw-cli, sndioctl, etc.

\- Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

.TP
.B \-a \-C\fR
.br
\- Adds CPU generation, process node, and built years, if detected. For Intel, 
only will show if Core generation, otherwise the arch value is enough. For AMD, 
only shows Zen generation. 

\- Adds microarchitecture \fBlevel:\fR (v1,v2,v3,v4) (64 bit Intel/AMD CPUs 
only). This information is used for setting compile time optimization switches 
in for example GCC. These levels were introduced in 2020.

Because this a CPU flag based test, and these levels when > 2 are not always 
100% based on exposed CPU flags (eg OSXSAVE), for > v2, adds \fBnote: check\fR.

\- Adds CPU family, model\-id, and stepping (replaces \fBrev\fR of \fB\-Cx\fR). 
Format is \fBhexadecimal (decimal)\fR if greater than 9, otherwise 
\fBhexadecimal\fR. 

\- Adds CPU microcode. Format is \fBhexadecimal\fR.

\- Adds socket type (for motherboard CPU socket, if available). If results 
doubtful will list two socket types and \fBnote: check\fR. Requires 
doas/sudo/root and \fBdmidecode\fR. The item in parentheses may simply be a 
different syntax for the same socket, but in general, check this before trusting 
it.

Sample: \fBsocket: 775 (478) note: check\fR
.br
Sample: \fBsocket: AM4\fR

\- Adds DMI CPU base and boost/turbo speeds. Requires doas/sudo/root and 
\fBdmidecode\fR. In some cases, like with overclocking or 'turbo' or 'boost' 
modes, voltage and external clock speeds may be increased, or short term limits 
raised on max CPU speeds. These are often not reflected in /sys based CPU 
\fBmin/max:\fR speed results, but often are using this source.

Samples:
.br
CPU not overclocked, with boost, like Ryzen:
.nf
\fBSpeed (MHz): 
  avg: 2861 
  high: 3250 
  min/max: 1550/3400 
  boost: enabled
  base/boost: 3400/3900\fR 
.fi
Overclocked 2900 MHz CPU, with no boost available: 
.nf
\fBSpeed (MHz): 
  avg: 2345 
  high: 2900 
  min/max: 800/2900
  base/boost: 3350/3000\fR
.fi
Overclocked 3000 MHz CPU, with boosted max speed:
.nf
\fBSpeed (MHz): 
  avg: 3260
  high: 4190
  min/max: 1200/3001
  base/boost: 3000/4000\fR
.fi

Note that these numbers can be confusing, but basically, the \fBbase\fR
number is the actual normal top speed the CPU runs at without boost mode, and 
the \fBboost\fR number is the max speed the CPU reports itself able to run at. 
The actual max speed may be higher than either value, or lower. The \fBboost\fR 
number appears to be hard\-coded into the CPU DMI data, and does not seem to 
reflect actual max speeds that overclocking or other combinations of speed 
boosters can enable, as you can see from the example where the CPU is running 
at a speed faster than the min/max or base/boost values.

Note that the normal \fBmin/max:\fR speeds do NOT show actual overclocked OR
boost/turbo mode speeds, and appear to be hard\-coded values, not dynamic real
values. The \fBbase/boost:\fR values are sometimes real, and sometimes not. 
\fBbase\fR appears in general to be real.

\- Adds frequency \fBscaling: governor:.. driver:..\fR if found/available. Also 
adds scaling min/max speeds if different from standard CPU min/max spees (not 
common).

\- Adds description of cache topology per cpu. Linux only.

\- Creates new \fBTopology:\fR line after the \fBInfo:\fR line. Moves cache data 
to this line from \fBInfo:\fR line. 

Topology line contains, if available and/or relevant: physical CPU count 
(\fBcpus:\fR); per physical cpu core count (cores:\fR); threads per core, if > 1 
(\fBtpc:\fR); how many \fBthreads:\fR (if more threads than cores); \fBdies:\fR 
(rarely detected, but if so, if > 1); smt status (if no smt status found, shows 
\fBN/A\fR). 

If complex CPU type, like Alder lake, cores; will have a more granular breakdown 
of how many mt (multi\-threaded) and how many st (single\-threaded) cores there 
in the physical cpu ( \fBmt\-cores:\fR, \fBst\-cores:\fR);  For complex CPU 
types like ARM SoC devices with 2 CPU types, with different core counts and/or 
\fBmin/max:\fR) frequencies, \fBvariant:\fR per type found, with relevant 
differences shown, like \fBcores:\fR, \fBmin/max:\fR, etc.

\- Adds logical and physical block size in bytes. 

Using \fBsmartctl\fR (requires doas/sudo/root privileges). 

\- Adds device model family, like \fBCaviar Black\fR, if available.

\- Adds SATA type (eg 1.0, 2.6, 3.0) if a SATA device.

\- Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

\- Adds SMART report line: status, enabled/disabled, health, powered on, cycles, 
and some error cases if out of range values. Note that for Pre\-fail items, it 
will show the VALUE and THRESHOLD numbers. It will also fall back for unknown 
attributes that are or have been failing and print out the Attribute name, 
value, threshold, and failing message. This way even for unhandled Attribute 
names, you should get a solid report for full failure cases. Other cases may 
show if inxi believes that the item may be approaching failure. This is a guess 
so make sure to check the drive and smartctl full output to verify before taking 
any further action.

\- Adds, for USB or other external drives, actual model name/serial if 
available, and different from enclosure model/serial, and corrects block sizes 
if necessary. 

\- Adds for USB drives USB mode (Linux only).

\- Adds in drive temperature for some drives as well, and other useful data.

.TP
.B \-a \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)

shown. Bluetooth PCIe rare). 

\- Adds for USB devices USB mode (Linux only).

.TP
.B \-a \-G\fR
\- Adds, if present, possible \fBalternate:\fR kernel modules capable of driving

non\-driver modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module 
does NOT mean it is available in the system, it's just something the kernel 
knows could possibly be used instead. 

\- Adds (AMD/Intel/Nvidia, if available) \fBprocess: [node] built: [years]\fR 
to \fBarch:\fR item.

\- Adds (if Linux and Nvidia device) non\-free support information (if 
available). This can be useful for forum support people to determine if the card 
supports current active legacy Nvidia driver branches, or if the card nonfree 
driver is EOL or active. Note that if card is current, shows basic series and 
status. 

Includes extended non free Nvidia legacy informatin (Linux and Nvidia only), and 
\fBarch:\fR reports (AMD/Intel/Nvidia). Useful to help diagnose driver support 
issues, shows extra data that can help diagnose/debug. Adds \fBcode:\fR item if 
found and not the same as \fBarch:\fR.

\- \fBcolors\fR \- Same as \fB\-Y \-2\fR . Do not remove colors from piped or 
redirected output.

\- \fBdmidecode\fR \- Force use of \fBdmidecode\fR. This will override 
\fB/sys\fR data in some lines, e.g. \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-B\fR.

\- \fBhddtemp\fR \- Force use of hddtemp instead of /sys temp data for disks.

\- \fBlsusb\fR \- Forces the USB data generator to use \fBlsusb\fR as data 
source (default). Overrides \fBUSB_SYS\fR in user configuration file(s).

\- \fBrpm\fR, \fBpkg\fR \- Force override of disabled RPM package counts on 
primarily RPM run systems due to unacceptably slow execution times for this 
command:

.nf
\fBrpm \-qa \-\-nodigest \-\-nosignature\fR
.fi

Even on newer RPM systems, in virtual machines, running rpm package list query 
takes more than 0.15 seconds (compared to 0.01 to 0.05 for dpkg, pacman, pkgtool 
etc) for just this single feature, which is north of 10% of total execution time 
for \fBinxi \-bar\fR. On bare metal this can hit 1 second or more in our tests. 
Older systems have taken up to 30 seconds to run this command! 

For systems that support running rpm along with the primary package installer 
(dpkg/apt, pacman, and pkgtool/slackpkg), there are not going to be many rpms, 
if any, installed, so the command runs in those cases (if inxi can determine it 
is running in that type of system).

\- \fBsensors\-sys\fR \- Force use of \fB/sys/class/hwmon\fR data for sensors 
(excluding ipmi sensors, which are their own line if present), skip 
\fBlm\-sensors\fR. Generally useful for testing since sys data is used if no 
lm\-sensors data was found anyway, but if \fBlm\-sensors\fR was installed, and 
returned no data, it's most likely if not nearly certain that \fB/sys\fR will 
also not return data.

\- \fBusb\-sys\fR \- Forces the USB data generator to use \fB/sys\fR as data 
source instead of \fBlsusb\fR (Linux only).

\- \fBvmstat\fR \- Forces use of vmstat for memory data.

\- \fBwayland\fR \- Forces use of Wayland, disables x tools glxinfo, xrandr, 
xdpyinfo.

\- \fBwmctrl\fR \- Force \fBSystem\fR item \fBwm\fR to use \fBwmctrl\fR as data 
source, override default \fBps\fR source.

.TP
.B \-\-hddtemp\fR
Shortcut. See \fB\-\-force hddtemp\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-html\-wan\fR
Temporary override of \fBNO_HTML_WAN\fR configuration item. Only use to test 
w/wo HTML downloaders for WAN IP. Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is 
use HTML downloader if present and if dig failed.

.TP
.B \-\-man\fR
Updates / installs man page with \fB\-U\fR if \fBpinxi\fR or using \fB\-U 3\fR 
dev branch. (Only active if \fB\-U\fR is is not disabled by maintainers).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-dig\fR
Overrides default use of \fBdig\fR to get WAN IP address. Allows use of normal 
downloader tool to get IP addresses. Only use if dig is failing, since dig is 
much faster and more reliable in general than other methods.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-doas\fR
Skips the use of doas to run certain internal features (like \fBhddtemp\fR, 
\fBfile\fR) with doas. Not related to running inxi itself with doas/sudo or 
super user. Some systems will register errors which will then trigger admin 
emails in such cases, so if you want to disable regular user use of doas 
(which requires configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use 
this option, or \fBNO_DOAS\fR configuration item. See \fB\-\-no\-sudo\fR if 
you need to disable both types.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-html-wan\fR
Overrides use of HTML downloaders to get WAN IP address. Use either only dig, 
or do not get wan IP. Only use if dig is failing, and the HTML downloaders are 
taking too long, or are hanging or failing. 

Make permanent with \fBNO_HTML_WAN='true'\fR

.TP
.B \-\-no\-man\fR
Disables man page install with \fB\-U\fR for master and active development 
branches. (Only active if \fB\-U\fR is is not disabled by maintainers).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-sensor\-force\fR
Overrides user set \fBSENSOR_FORCE\fR configuration value. Restores default 
behavior. 

.TP
.B \-\-no\-ssl\fR
Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions (\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-w\fR,
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-i\fR). Use if your system does not have current SSL certificate
lists, or if you have problems making a connection for any reason. Works with
\fBWget\fR, \fBCurl\fR, \fBPerl HTTP::Tiny\fR and \fBFetch\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-sudo\fR
Skips the use of sudo to run certain internal features (like \fBhddtemp\fR, 
\fBfile\fR) with sudo. Not related to running inxi itself with sudo or 
superuser. Some systems will register errors which will then trigger admin 
emails in such cases, so if you want to disable regular user use of sudo (which 
requires configuration to setup anyway for these options) just use this option, 
or \fBNO_SUDO\fR configuration item.

.TP
.B \-\-pm\-type [package manager name]\fR
For distro package maintainers only, and only for non apt, rpm, or pacman 
based systems. To be used to test replacement package lists for recommends 
for that package manager.

.TP
.B \-\-rpm\fR, \fB\-\-pkg\fR
Shortcut. See \fB\-\-force rpm\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-default\fR
Overrides configuration values \fBSENSORS_USE\fR or \fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR
on a one time basis. 

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-exclude\fR
Linux only. Similar to \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR except removes listed sensors from 
sensor data. Make permanent with \fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR configuration item. Note 
that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device monitor chips are excluded by 
default.

Example: \fBinxi \-sxx \-\-sensors\-exclude k10temp-pci-00c3\fR

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-sys\fR
Shortcut. See \fB\-\-force sensors\-sys\fR

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-use\fR
Linux only. Use only the (comma separated) sensor arrays for \fB\-s\fR output. 
Make permanent with \fBSENSORS_USE\fR configuration item. Sensor array ID value 
must be the exact value shown in lm\-sensors sensors output (lm-sensors only) or 
use \fB\-s \-\-dbg 18\fR ('main' =>.. section) to see the sensor ID strings used 
internally. If you only want to exclude one (or more) sensors from the output, 
use \fB\-\-sensors\-exclude\fR.

Can be useful if the default sensor data used by inxi is not from the right 
sensor array. Note that all other sensor data will be removed, which may lead 
to undesired consequences. Please be aware that this can lead to many 
undesirable side\-effects, since default behavior is to use all the sensors 
arrays and select which values to use from them following a set sequence of 
rules. So if you force one to be used, you may lose data that was used from 
another one.

Most likely best use is when one (or two) of the sensor arrays has all the 
sensor data you want, and you just want to make sure inxi doesn't use data 
from another array that has inaccurate or misleading data.

Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device monitor chips are 
excluded by default, and should not be added since they do not provide cpu, 
board, system, etc, sensor data.

Example: \fBinxi \-sxx \-\-sensors\-use nct6791-isa-0290,k10temp-pci-00c3\fR

.TP
.B \-\-sleep [0\-x.x]\fR
Usually in decimals. Change CPU sleep time for \fB\-C\fR (current: \fB\0.35\fR).
Sleep is used to let the system catch up and show a more accurate CPU use. 
Example:

\fBinxi \-Cxxx \-\-sleep 0.15\fR

Overrides default internal value and user configuration value:

\fBCPU_SLEEP=0.25\fR

.TP
.B \-\-tty\fR
Forces internal IRC flag to off. Used in unhandled cases where the program 
running inxi may not be seen as a shell/pty/tty, but it is not an IRC client. 
Put \fB\-\-tty\fR first in option list to avoid unexpected errors. If you want 
a specific output width, use the \fB\-\-width\fR option. If you want normal 
color codes in the output, use the \fB\-c [color ID]\fR flag.

The sign you need to use this is extra numbers before the key/value pairs of 
the output of your program. These are IRC, not TTY, color codes. Please post a 
github issue if you find you need to use \fB\-\-tty\fR (including the full 
\fB\-Ixxx\fR line) so we can figure out how to add your program to the list of 
whitelisted programs.

You can see what inxi believed started it in the \fB\-Ixxx\fR line, 
\fBShell:\fR or \fBClient:\fR item. Please let us know what that result was 
so we can add it to the parent start program whitelist.

In some cases, you may want to also use \fB\-\-no\-filter\fR/\fB\-Z\fR option if 
you want to see filtered values. Filtering is turned on by default if \fBinxi\fR 
believes it is running in an IRC client.

Force \fB\-i\fR to use supplied URL as WAN IP source. Overrides dig or 
default IP source urls. URL must start with http[s] or ftp.

The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non\-empty) 
line of the page content source code.

Same as configuration value (example):

\fBWAN_IP_URL='https://mysite.com/ip.php'\fR

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-dbg {[1\-x][,[1\-x]]}\fR
Accepts one or more comma separated dbg specific debugging numbers.

\fB1\fR \- Debug downloader failures. Turns off silent/quiet mode for curl, wget, 
and fetch. Shows more downloader action information. Shows some more information 
for Perl downloader.

\fB1\-xx\fR \- See github \fBinxi\-perl/docs/inxi\-values.txt\fR for specific 
specialized debugging options. There are a lot.

.TP
.B \-\-debug [1\-3]\fR
\- On screen debugger output. 

.TP
.B \-\-debug 10\fR
\- Basic logging. Check \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/inxi/inxi.log\fR or
\fB$HOME/.local/share/inxi/inxi.log\fR or \fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.log\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 11\fR
\- Full file/system info logging.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 20\fR
Creates a tar.gz file of system data and collects the inxi output
in a file.

* tree traversal data file(s) read from \fB/proc\fR and \fB/sys\fR, and 
other system data.

* xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.

* data from dev, disks, partitions, etc.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 21\fR
Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.smxi.org\fR,
then removes the debug data directory, but leaves the debug tar.gz file.
See \fB\-\-ftp\fR for uploading to alternate locations.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 22\fR
Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.smxi.org\fR, then
removes the debug data directory and the tar.gz file.
See \fB\-\-ftp\fR for uploading to alternate locations.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-id [string]\fR
Insert string to file name for debugger. This is helpful so you can add for 
instance a username to a debugger dataset to make it easy to find.

Sample: \fB\-\-debug 22 \-\-debug\-id mrmazda\fR

.TP
.B \-\-fake\-data\-dir\fR
Developer only: Change default location of $fake_data_dir, which is where files 
are for \fB\-\-fake {item}\fR items.

.TP
.B \-\-ftp [ftp.yoursite.com/incoming]\fR
For alternate ftp upload locations: Example:

\fBinxi \-\-ftp \fIftp.yourserver.com/incoming\fB \-\-debug 21\fR

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES
Only use the following in conjunction with \fB\-\-debug 2[012]\fR, and only 
use if you experienced a failure or hang, or were instructed to do so.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-proc\fR
Force debugger to parse \fB/proc\fR directory data when run as root. Normally 
this is disabled due to unpredictable data in /proc tree. 

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-proc\-print\fR
Use this to locate file that /proc debugger hangs on.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-exit\fR
Skip exit on error when running debugger.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-proc\fR
Skip /proc debugging in case of a hang.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-sys\fR
Skip /sys debugging in case of a hang.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-sys\fR
Force PowerPC debugger parsing of /sys as doas/sudo/root.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-sys\-print\fR
Use this to locate file that /sys debugger hangs on.

.SH SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS
BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, 
Weechat, and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying either 
built\-in or external script output.

.SH RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the
list below:
.TP
.B Hexchat, XChat, Irssi
\fR(and many other IRC clients)
.B /exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]
If you don't include the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local
IRC client.
.TP
.B Konversation
.B /cmd inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

To run inxi in Konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi 
package hasn't already done this for you, create this symbolic link:

KDE 4:
.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

KDE 5:
.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi

If inxi is somewhere else, change the path \fB/usr/local/bin\fR to wherever it
is located.

If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also need to add the following to get
the Konversation \fR/inxi\fR command to work:

.B ln \-s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/

Make sure you also have the \fRqdbus\-qt5\fR package (Debian/Ubuntu + derived), 
\fRqt5\-qttools\fR (Fedora/RHEL/SUSE + derived),  \fRqt5\-tools\fR (Arch + 
derived) installed (for KDE 5/QT 5, check distros for future package names), 
\fRqt5\-tools\fR (Arch + derived). Check your distro if the program is missing. 
Depending on the distro, \fR/usr/lib/qt5/bin/qdbus\fR is required, which in 
Debian+ is provided by the above package.

Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

.B /inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
.TP
.B WeeChat
.B NEW: /exec \-o inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

.B OLD: /shell \-o inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console
IRC clients, with \fB/exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]. Newer WeeChats
have dropped the \fB\-curses\fR part of their program name, i.e.:
\fBweechat\fR instead of \fBweechat\-curses\fR.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
inxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the
following order:

\fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR contains the default configurations. These can be 
overridden by creating a \fB/etc/inxi.d/inxi.conf\fR file (global override), 
which will prevent distro packages from changing or overwriting your edits. This 
method is recommended if you are using a distro packaged inxi and want to 
override some global configuration items from the package's default 
\fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR file but don't want to lose your changes on a package 
update. 

You can also override, per user, with a user configuration file found in one of 
the following locations (inxi will store its config file using the following 
precedence):

if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not empty, it will go there, else if
\fB$HOME/.config/inxi.conf\fR exists, it will go there, and as a last default,
the legacy location is used), i.e.:

\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf\fR > \fB$HOME/.config/inxi.conf\fR >
\fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf\fR > \fB/etc/inxi.d/inxi.conf\fR > \fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

See the documentation page for more complete information on how to set
these up, and for a complete list of options:

.I https://smxi.org/docs/inxi\-configuration.htm
.TP
.B Basic Options
Here's a brief overview of the basic options you are likely to want to use:

\fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR The max display column width on terminal. If 
terminal/console width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than wrap width, wrapping of 
line starter occurs

\fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR The max display column width on IRC clients.

\fBCOLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY\fR The max display column width in out of X / Wayland / 
desktop / window manager.

\fBCPU_SLEEP\fR Decimal value \fB0\fR or more. Default is usually around 
\fB0.35\fR seconds. Time that inxi will 'sleep' before getting CPU speed data, 
so that it reflects actual system state.

\fBDOWNLOADER\fR Sets default inxi downloader: curl, fetch, ftp, perl, wget.
See \fB\-\-recommends\fR output for more information on downloaders and Perl 
downloaders.

\fBFILTER_STRING\fR Default \fB<filter>\fR. Any string you prefer to see 
instead for filtered values.

\fBINDENT\fR Change primary indent width of wide mode output. See 
\fB\-\-indent\fR.

\fBINDENTS\fR Change primary indents of narrow wrapped mode output, and second 
level indents. See \fB\-\-indents\fR.

\fBLIMIT\fR Overrides default of \fB10\fR IP addresses per IF. This is only of 
interest to sys admins running servers with many IP addresses.

\fBLINES_MAX\fR Values: [\-2\-xxx]. See \fB\-Y\fR for explanation and values. 
Use \fB\-Y \-3\fR to restore default unlimited output lines. Avoid using this in 
general unless the machine is a headless system and you want the output to be 
always controlled.

\fBMAX_WRAP\fR (or \fBWRAP_MAX\fR) The maximum width where the line starter 
wraps to its own line. If terminal/console width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than 
wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs. Overrides default. See 
\fB\-\-max\-wrap\fR. If \fB80\fR or less, wrap will never happen.

\fBNO_DIG\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable WAN IP use of \fBdig\fR 
and force use of alternate downloaders.

\fBNO_DOAS\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable internal use of 
\fBdoas\fR.

\fBNO_HTML_WAN\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable WAN IP use of 
\fBHTML Downloaders\fR and force use of dig only, or nothing if dig disabled 
as well. Same as \fB\-\-no\-html\-wan\fR. Only use if dig is failing, and 
HTML downloaders are hanging.

\fBNO_SUDO\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable internal use of 
\fBsudo\fR.

\fBPARTITION_SORT\fR Overrides default partition output sort. See 
\fB\-\-partition\-sort\fR for options.

\fBPS_COUNT\fR The default number of items showing per \fB\-t\fR type, \fBm\fR 
or \fBc\fR. Default is 5.

\fBSENSORS_CPU_NO\fR In cases of ambiguous temp1/temp2 (inxi can't figure out 
which is the CPU), forces sensors to use either value 1 or 2 as CPU 
temperature. See the above configuration page on smxi.org for full info.

\fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR Exclude supplied sensor array[s] from sensor output. 
Override with \fB\-\-sensors\-default\fR. See \fB\-\-sensors\-exclude\fR.

\fBSENSORS_USE\fR Use only supplied sensor array[s]. Override with 
\fB\-\-sensors\-default\fR. See \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR.

\fBSEP2_CONSOLE\fR Replaces default key / value separator of '\fB:\fR'. Test 
with \fB\-\-separator\fR.

\fBUSB_SYS\fR Forces all USB data to use \fB/sys\fR instead of \fBlsusb\fR.

\fBWAN_IP_URL\fR Forces \fB\-i\fR to use supplied URL, and to not use dig 
(dig is generally much faster). URL must begin with http or ftp. Note that if 
you use this, the downloader set tests will run each time you start inxi 
whether a downloader feature is going to be used or not. 

The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non\-empty) 
line of the URL's page content source code.

Same as \fB\-\-wan\-ip\-url [URL]\fR

\fBWEATHER_SOURCE\fR Values: [\fB0-9\fR]. Same as \fB\-\-weather\-source\fR. 
Values 4\-9 are not currently supported, but this can change at any time.

\fBWEATHER_UNIT\fR Values: [\fBm\fR|\fBi\fR|\fBmi\fR|\fBim\fR]. Same as 
\fB\-\-weather\-unit\fR.

.TP
.B Color Options
It's best to use the \fB\-c [94\-99]\fR color selector tool to set the 
following values because it will correctly update the configuration file and 
remove any invalid or conflicting items, but if you prefer to create your own 
configuration files, here are the options. All take the integer value from the 
options available in \fB\-c 94\-99\fR.

NOTE: All default and configuration file set color values are removed when 
output is piped or redirected. You must use the explicit 
\fB\-c [color number]\fR option if you want colors to be present in the 
piped/redirected output (creating a PDF for example).

\fBCONSOLE_COLOR_SCHEME\fR The color scheme for console output (not in 
X/Wayland).

\fBGLOBAL_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Overrides all other color schemes.

\fBIRC_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Desktop X/Wayland IRC CLI color scheme.

\fBIRC_CONS_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Out of X/Wayland, IRC CLI color scheme.

\fBIRC_X_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME\fR In X/Wayland IRC client terminal color scheme.

\fBVIRT_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Color scheme for virtual terminal output (in 
X/Wayland).

.TP
.B Developer Options
These are useful only for developers.

\fBFAKE_DATA_DIR\fR \- change default fake data directory location. See 
\fB\-\-fake\-data\-dir\fR. 

.SH BUGS
Please report bugs using the following resources.

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool (see \fB\-\-debug 21/22\fR), 
which will upload a data dump of system files for use in debugging inxi. These 
data dumps are very important since they provide us with all the real system 
data inxi uses to parse out its report.

.SH SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING

The nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux\-smokers\-club and #smxi, who 
all really have to be considered to be co\-developers because of their non\-stop 
enthusiasm and willingness to provide real\-time testing and debugging of inxi 
development over the years.

LinuxQuestions.org Slackware forum members, for major help with development and 
debugging new or refactored features, particularly the redone CPU logic of 
2021\-12.

Siduction forum members, who have helped get some features working by providing 
a large number of datasets that have revealed possible variations, particularly 
for the RAM \fB\-m\fR option.

AntiX users and admins, who have helped greatly with testing and debugging,
particularly for the 3.0.0 release.

ArcherSeven (Max), Brett Bohnenkamper (aka KittyKatt), and Iotaka, who always 
manage to find the weirdest or most extreme hardware and setups that help make 
inxi much more robust.

For the vastly underrated skill of output error/glitch catching, Pete Haddow. 
His patience and focus in going through inxi repeatedly to find errors and 
inconsistencies is much appreciated.

For a huge boost to BSD support, Stan Vandiver, who did a lot of testing
and setup many remote access systems for testing and development.

For testing, bug finding, suggestions, feature requests, MrMazda. He has over 
the years has helped shape inxi into what it is today, in particular but not 
limited to, the Graphics features. 

All the inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum moderators,
and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, which almost always
help make inxi better, and any others who contribute ideas, suggestions, and 
patches.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel\-based Free Desktop systems to 
test on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's 
turning out to be.

And of course, a big thanks to locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core 
ideas, logic, and tricks originally used in inxi Gawk/Bash.
