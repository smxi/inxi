.SH NAME
inxi  \- Command line system information script for console and IRC 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBinxi\fR \- Single line, short form. Very basic output.

\fBinxi \fR[\fB\-AbBCdDfFGhHiIlmMnNopPrRsSuw\fR]  \fR[\fB\-c  NUMBER\fR] \fR[\fB\-v  NUMBER\fR]

\fBinxi \fR[\fB\-t \fR(\fBc\fR or\fB m\fR or\fB cm\fR or\fB mc NUMBER\fR)] \fR[\fB\-x \-OPTION\fR(\fBs\fR)] \fR[\fB\-xx \-OPTION\fR(\fBs\fR)] \fR[\fB\-xxx \-OPTION\fR(\fBs\fR)]

\fBinxi \fR[\fB\-\-help\fR] \fR[\fB\-\-recommends\fR] \fR[\fB\-\-version\fR] \fR[\fB\-@ NUMBER\fR] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinxi\fR is a command line system information script built for for console and IRC. It is also used for forum technical support, as a debugging tool, to quickly ascertain user system configuration and hardware. inxi shows system 
hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of other 
useful information. 

\fBinxi\fR output varies between CLI and IRC, with some default filters and color options applied to IRC use. Script colors can
be turned off if desired with \fB\-c 0\fR, or changed using the \fB\-c\fR color options listed in the OPTIONS section below.
.SH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi filters out automatically on IRC things like
your network card mac address, WAN and LAN IP, your \fB/home\fR username directory in partitions, 
and a few other things.

Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this filtering with the \fB\-z\fR
option (\fB\-Fz\fR, for example). To override the IRC filter, you can use the \fB\-Z\fR option. This can be useful 
to debug network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.
.SH USING OPTIONS
Options can be combined if they do not conflict. Either group the letters 
together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion unless using \fB \-t\fR.

For example: 
.B inxi 
\fB\-AG\fR or \fBinxi \-A \-G\fR or \fBinxi \-c10\fR

.SH STANDARD OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \-A  
Show Audio/sound card information.
.TP
.B \-b  
Shows basic output, short form (previously \fB\-d\fR). Same as: \fBinxi \-v 2\fR
.TP
.B \-B  
Shows Battery data, charge, condition, plus extra information (if battery present). 
Uses \fB/sys\fR or for BSDs, \fBdmidecode\fR. \fBdmidecode\fR does not have very much information, 
and none about current battery state/charge/voltage. Supports multiple batteries
when using \fB/sys\fR data.

Note on the \fBcharge\fR item, the output shows the current charge, and the percent of 
the available capacity, which can be less than the original design capacity. In the 
following example, the actual current capacity of the battery is \fB22.2 Wh\fR, 
so the charge shows what percent of the current capacity is charged.

For example: \fB20.1 Wh 95.4%\fR

The \fBcondition\fR item shows the current available capacity / original design capacity,
then the percentage of original capacity available in the battery. In the following
example, the battery capacity is only 61% of it's original amount.

For example: \fB22.2/36.4 Wh 61%\fR
.TP
.B \-c 
\fR[\fB0\fR\-\fB32\fR] 
Available color schemes. Scheme number is required. 
  
Supported color schemes: \fB0\-42\fR
.TP	 
.B \-c 
\fR[\fB94\fR\-\fB99\fR]

Color selectors run a color selector option  prior to inxi starting which lets 
you set the config file value for the selection.

Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: irc and global only show safe color set):
.TP
.B \-c 94\fR
\- Console, out of X.
.TP
.B \-c 95\fR
\- Terminal, running in X \- like xTerm.
.TP
.B \-c 96\fR
\- Gui IRC, running in X \- like Xchat, Quassel, 
Konversation etc.
.TP
.B \-c 97\fR
\- Console IRC running in X \- like irssi in xTerm.
.TP
.B \-c 98\fR
\- Console IRC not in  X.
.TP
.B \-c 99\fR
\- Global \- Overrides/removes all settings.

Setting specific color type removes the global color selection.
.TP
.B \-C  
Show full CPU output, including per CPU clockspeed and CPU max speed (if available). If max speed data
present, shows \fB(max)\fR in short output formats (\fB\inxi\fR, \fB\inxi \-b\fR) if CPU actual speed 
matches CPU max speed. If CPU max speed does not match CPU actual speed, shows both actual and max speed
information. See \fB\-x\fR and \fB\-xx\fR for more options. 
.TP
.B \-d  
Shows optical drive data. Same as \fB\-Dd\fR. With \fB\-x\fR, adds features line to output. Also shows 
floppy disks if present. Note that there is no current way to get any information about the floppy device 
that I am aware of, so it will simply show the floppy id, without any extra data.
\fB\-xx\fR adds a few more features.
.TP
.B \-D  
Show full hard Disk info, not only model, ie: \fB/dev/sda ST380817AS 80.0GB\fR. Shows disk space 
total + used percentage.  The disk used percentage includes space used by swap partition(s), since 
those are not usable for data storage. Note that with RAID disks, the percentage will be wrong
since the total is computed from the disk sizes, but the used is computed from mounted partition used
percentages. This small defect may get corrected in the future. Also, unmounted partitions are not
counted in disk use percentages since inxi has no access to that data.
.TP
.B \-f  
Show all cpu flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR to avoid 
spamming. ARM cpus: show \fBfeatures\fR items.
.TP
.B \-F  
Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters, plus \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-n\fR.
Does not show extra verbose options like \fB\-d \-f \-l \-m \-o \-p \-r \-t \-u \-x\fR unless you use 
those arguments in the command, like: \fBinxi \-Frmxx\fR
.TP
.B \-G  
Show Graphic card information. Card(s), Display Server (vendor and version number), for example: 
\fBDisplay Server: Xorg 1.15.1 \fR
,screen resolution(s), OpenGL renderer, OpenGL core profile version/OpenGL version. 

If detected (currently only available if on a desktop: will attempt to show the server type, ie, x11, 
wayland, mir. When xorg is present, its version information will show 
after the server type in parentheses. Future versions will show compositor information as well.
.TP
.B \-h
The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set script global \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR
if you want a different default value, or use \fB\-y <width>\fR to temporarily override the defaults or actual window width.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Same as \fB\-h\fR
.TP
.B \-H
The help menu, plus developer options. Do not use dev options in normal 
operation!
.TP
.B \-i  
Show Wan IP address, and shows local interfaces (requires \fBifconfig\fR or \fBip\fR network tool). 
Same as \-Nni. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR for user security reasons, you shouldn't 
paste your local/wan IP. Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP address.

.TP
.B \-I  
Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, irc client (or shell type if run in shell, not irc), inxi version.  
See \fB\-x\fR and \fB\-xx\fR for extra information (init type/version, runlevel).
.TP
.B \-l  
Show partition labels. Default: short partition \fB\-P\fR. For full \fB\-p\fR output, use: \fB\-pl\fR (or \fB\-plu\fR).
.TP
.B \-m  
Memory (RAM) data. Does not show with  \fB\-b\fR or  \fB\-F\fR unless you use  \fB\-m\fR explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) (\fBArray\-[number] capacity:\fR), and individual memory devices (\fBDevice\-[number]\fR). Physical memory array(s) data shows array capacity, and number of devices supported, and Error Correction information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax), size, speed, type (eg: \fBtype: DDR3\fR). 

Note that \fB\-m\fR uses \fBdmidecode\fR, which must be run as root (or start \fBinxi\fR with \fBsudo\fR), unless you figure out how to set up sudo to permit dmidecode to read \fB/dev/mem\fR as user. Note that speed will not show if \fBNo Module Installed\fR is found in size. This will also turn off Bus Width data output if it is null. 

If memory information was found, and if the \fB\-I\fR line or the \fB\-tm\fR item have not been triggered, 
will also print the ram used/total.

Because dmidecode data is extremely unreliable, inxi will try to make best guesses. If you see \fB(check)\fR after capacity number, you should check it for sure with specifications. \fB(est)\fR is slightly more reliable, but you should still check the real specifications before buying ram. Unfortunately there is nothing \fBinxi\fR can do to get truly reliable data about the system ram, maybe one day the kernel devs will put this data into \fB/sys\fR, and make it real data, taken from the actual system, not dmi data. For most people, the data will be right, but a significant percentage of users will have either wrong max module size, if present, or max capacity.
.TP
.B \-M  
Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, Bios, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo).
Older systems/kernels without the required \fB/sys\fR data can use dmidecode instead, run as root. If using dmidecode,
may also show bios revision as well as version. \fB\-! 33\fR can force use of \fBdmidecode\fR data instead of \fB/sys\fR. 
Will also attempt to show if the system was booted by BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy]. The last one is legacy BIOS boot mode
in a systemboard using UEFI but booted as BIOS/Legacy.

Device requires either /sys or dmidecode. Note that 'other\-vm?' is a type that means it's usually a vm, but inxi
failed to detect which type, or to positively confirm which vm it is. Primary vm identification is via systemd\-detect\-virt
but fallback tests that should support some BSDs as well are used. Less commonly used or harder to detect VMs may not
be correctly detected, if you get a wrong output, post an issue and we'll get it fixed if possible.

Due to unreliable vendor data, device will show: desktop; laptop; notebook; server; blade plus some obscure stuff that
inxi is unlikely to ever run on. 
.TP
.B \-n  
Show Advanced Network card information. Same as \fB\-Nn\fR. Shows interface, speed, 
mac id, state, etc.
.TP
.B \-N  
Show Network card information. With \fB\-x\fR, shows PCI BusID, Port number.
.TP
.B \-o  
Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).
Shows file system type if you have \fBfile\fR installed, if you are root OR if you have
added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer): 

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

Does not show components (partitions that create the md raid array) of md\-raid arrays.
.TP
.B \-p  
Show full partition information (\fB\-P\fR plus all other detected partitions).
.TP
.B \-P  
Show Partition information (shows what \fB\-v 4\fR would show, but without extra data).
Shows, if detected: \fB/ /boot /home /opt /tmp /usr /var /var/tmp /var/log\fR. Use \fB\-p\fR to see all mounted partitions.
.TP
.B \-r  
Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

\fBAPK\fR (Alpine Linux + derived versions)

\fBAPT\fR (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions)

\fBPACMAN\fR (Arch Linux + derived versions)

\fBPISI\fR (Pardus + derived versions)

\fBURPMQ\fR (Mandriva, Mageia + derived versions)

\fBYUM/ZYPP\fR (Fedora, Redhat, Suse + derived versions)

(as distro data is collected more will be added. If your's is missing please show us how to get this 
information and we'll try to add it.)
.TP
.B \-R
Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, and components, and extra data with \fB\-x\fR / \fB\-xx\fR. 
md\-raid: If device is resyncing, shows resync progress line as well. 
.TP
.B \-\-recommends   
Checks inxi application dependencies + recommends, and directories, then shows
what package(s) you need to install to add support for that feature.
.TP
.B \-s
Show sensors output (if sensors installed/configured): mobo/cpu/gpu temp; detected 
fan speeds. Gpu temp only for Fglrx/Nvidia drivers. Nvidia shows screen number for > 1 screens.
.TP
.B \-S  
Show System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X), distro. With \fB\-xx\fR show
dm \- or startx \- (only shows if present and running if out of X), and if in X, with \fB\-xxx\fR show more desktop info, like shell/panel etc.
.TP
.B \-t 
\fR[\fBc\fR or\fB m\fR or\fB cm\fR or\fB mc NUMBER\fR]\fR
Show processes. If followed by numbers \fB1\-20\fR, shows that number of processes for each type 
(default: \fB5\fR; if in irc, max: \fB5\fR)

Make sure to have no space between letters and numbers (\fB\-t cm10\fR \- right, \fB\-t cm 10\fR \- wrong).
.TP
.B \-t c\fR
\- cpu only. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also memory for that process on same line.
.TP
.B \-t m\fR
\- memory only. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also cpu for that process on same line. If the \-I line is not triggered,
will also show the system used/total ram information in the first \fBMemory\fR line of output.

\- cpu+memory. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also cpu or memory for that process on same line.
.TP
.B \-u  
Show partition UUIDs. Default: short partition \fB\-P\fR. For full \fB\-p\fR output, use: \fB\-pu\fR (or \fB\-plu\fR).
.TP
.B \-U
Note \- Maintainer may have disabled this function. 

If inxi \fB\-h\fR has no listing for \fB\-U\fR then it's disabled.

Auto\-update script. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root to update, 
otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this Man Page to: \fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR
(if \fB/usr/local/share/man/\fR exists AND there is no inxi man page in \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR, 
otherwise it goes to \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR)
This requires that you be root to write to that directory. 

Previous versions of inxi manually installed man page were installed to \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR. If 
you want the man page to go into \fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR move it there and inxi will update to 
that path from then on.
.TP
.B \-V 
inxi version information. Prints information then exits.
.TP
.B \-\-version
same as \fB\-V\fR
.TP
.B \-v

(names only). Same as: \fBinxi \-b\fR
.TP
.B \-v 3 
\- Adds advanced CPU (\fB\-C\fR); network (\fB\-n\fR) data; triggers \fB\-x\fR advanced data option.
.TP
.B \-v 4 
\- Adds partition size/filled data (\fB\-P\fR) for (if present):\fB/ /home /var/ /boot\fR
Shows full disk data (\fB\-D\fR)
.TP

triggers \fB\-xx\fR extra data option.
.TP
.B \-v 7 
\- Adds network IP data (\fB\-i\fR); triggers \fB\-xxx\fR
.TP
.B \-w  
Adds weather line. Note, this depends on an unreliable api so it may not always be working in the future.
To get weather for an alternate location, use \fB\-W <location_string>\fR. See also \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR option.
Please note, your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature, so if \fB\-w\fR or \fB\-W\fR don't work, that's why.
.TP
.B \-W <location_string>
Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code, city,state pair, or latitude,longitude.
Note: city/country/state names must not contain spaces. Replace spaces with '\fB+\fR' sign. No spaces around \fB,\fR (comma). 
Use only ascii letters in city/state/country names, sorry. 

Examples: \fB\-W 95623\fR OR \fB\-W Boston,MA\fR OR \fB\-W45.5234,\-122.6762\fR OR \fB\-W new+york,ny\fR
OR \fB\-W bodo,norway\fR.
.TP
.B \-y <integer >= 80>
This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max. Overrides \fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR / \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR globals, or the actual widths of the terminal. If used with \fB\-h\fR or \fB\-c 94\-99\fR, put \fB\-y\fR option first or the override will be ignored. Cannot be used with \fB\-\-help\fR/\fB\-\-version\fR/\fB\-\-recommends\fR type long options. Example: \fBinxi \-y 130 \-Fxx\fR
.TP
.B \-z  
Adds security filters for IP addresses, Mac, location (\fB\-w\fR), and user home directory name. Default on for irc clients.
.TP
.B \-Z  
Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking issues in irc for example.
.SH EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options are for long form only, and can be triggered by one or more \fB\-x\fR, like \fB\-xx\fR.
Alternately, the \fB\-v\fR options trigger them in the following way:
\fB\-v 3\fR adds \fB\-x\fR; \fB\-v 6\fR adds \fB\-xx\fR; \fB\-v 7\fR adds \fB\-xxx\fR

These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in\-depth data on various options.
Can be added to any long form option list, like: \fB\-bxx\fR or \fB\-Sxxx\fR

There are 3 extra data levels: \fB\-x\fR; \fB\-xx\fR; and \fB\-xxx\fR

The following shows which lines / items get extra information with each extra data level.
.TP
.B \-x \-A 
\- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each Audio device.

.TP
.B \-x \-i 
\- Show IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for each interface.

Note that there is no way I am aware of to filter out the deprecated IP v6 scope site/global 
temporary addresses from the output of \fBifconfig\fR. \fBip\fR tool shows that clearly.

\fBip\-v6\-temporary\fR \- (\fBip\fR tool only), scope global temporary. Scope global temporary deprecated is not shown

\fBip\-v6\-global\fR \- scope global (\fBifconfig\fR will show this for all types, global, global temporary,

\fBip\-v6\-site\fR \- scope site (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR). This has been deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. 
\fBifconfig\fR may show multiple site values, as with global temporary, and
global temporary deprecated.

\fBip\-v6\-unknown\fR \- unknown scope

\- Adds parent program (or tty) that started shell, if not IRC client, to shell information.
.TP
.B \-xx \-m
\- Shows memory device Manufacturer and Serial Number.
.TP
.B \-xx \-m
\- Single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may not be 100% right all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found in \fBdmidecode\fR output for \fBtype 6\fR and \fBtype 17\fR.
.TP
.B \-xx \-M 
\- Adds chassis information, if any data for that is available. Also shows BIOS rom size if using dmidecode.

obtaining the cycle count, so this almost always shows \fB0\fR. There's nothing that can be done about this glitch, the 
data is simply not available as of 2016\-04\-18), location (only available from dmidecode derived output).
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- Memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. eg: bus width: 64 bit (total: 72 bits). Note that total / data widths are mixed up sometimes in dmidecode output, so inxi will take the larger value as total if present. If no total width data is found, then inxi will not show that item.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- Adds device Type Detail, eg: DDR3 (Synchronous).
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- If present, will add memory module voltage. Only some systems will have this data available.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-S 
\- Adds, if run in X, shell/panel type info to Desktop information, if present. If none, shows nothing.
Supports some current desktop extras like gnome\-panel, lxde\-panel, and others. Added mainly for Mint support.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-w / \-W
\- Adds location (city state country), weather observation time, altitude of system.
If wind chill, heat index, or dew point are available, shows that data as well.
.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-! 31
Turns off hostname in System line. Useful, with \fB\-z\fR, for anonymizing your inxi output for posting on
forums or IRC.
.TP
.B \-! 32
Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set): B_SHOW_HOST='false'.
.TP
.B \-! 33
Force use of \fBdmidecode\fR. This will override \fB/sys\fR data in some lines, like \fB\-M\fR.
.TP
.B \-! 34
Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions (\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-w\fR, \fB\-W\fR, \fB\-i\fR). 
Use if your system does not have current SSL certificate lists, or if you have problems making a connection for 
any reason. Only works with \fBwget\fR, \fBcurl\fR, and \fBfetch\fR. This must go before the other options you use.

.TP
.B \-! 40
Will try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as root user). 
Default gets display info from display \fB:0\fR. If you use this format: \fB\-! 40:1\fR it 
would get it from display \fB1\fR instead, or any display you specify
as long as there is no space between \fB\-! 40\fR and the \fB:[display id]\fR. 

Note that in some cases, \fB\-! 40\fR will cause inxi to hang endlessly when running the option
in console with Intel graphics (confirmed). Other free drivers like nouveau/ati unknown yet. 
It may be that this is a bug with the intel graphics driver, more information required.

You can test this easily by running this command out of X/display server: \fBglxinfo -display :0\fR

If it hangs, \fB\-! 40\fR will not work.

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-%
Overrides defective or corrupted data.
.TP
.B \-@  
Triggers debugger output. Requires debugging level \fB1\-14\fR (\fB8\-10\fR \- logging of data).
Less than 8 just triggers inxi debugger output on screen.
.TP
.B \-@  
\fR[\fB1\fR\-\fB7\fR] \- On screen debugger output.
.TP
.B \-@ 8
\- Basic logging. Check \fB/home/yourname/.inxi/inxi*.log 
.TP
.B \-@ 9
\- Full file/sys info logging.
.TP
.B \-@ 10
\- Color logging.
.TP
.B \-@ <11\-14>
The following create a tar.gz file of system data, plus collecting the inxi output to file:
To automatically upload debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.techpatterns.com\fR: 

\fBinxi \-xx@ <11\-14>\fR

For alternate ftp upload locations: Example: 

.B inxi \-! 
\fIftp.yourserver.com/incoming\fB \-xx@ 14\fR
.TP
.B \-@ 11 
\- With data file of xiin read of \fB/sys
.TP
.B \-@ 12 
\- With xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.
.TP
.B \-@ 13 
\- With data from dev, disks, partitions, etc., plus xiin data file.
.TP
.B \-@ 14 
\- Everything, full data collection.
.SH SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS  
BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, Weechat, and Xchat. Plus any others that
are capable of displaying either built in or external script output.
.SH RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the list below:
.TP
.B Xchat, irssi 
\fR(and many other IRC clients)
.B /exec \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
If you leave off the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local IRC client.
.TP
.B Konversation
.B /cmd inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

To run inxi in konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi package did not do this for you, 
create this symbolic link: 

.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

If inxi is somewhere else, change the path \fB/usr/local/bin\fR to wherever it is located.

Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

.B /inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
.TP
.B WeeChat
.B NEW: /exec \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

.B OLD: /shell \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console IRC
clients, with \fB/exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]. Also, newer WeeChats have dropped
the \fB\-curses\fR part of their program name, ie: \fBweechat\fR instead of \fBweechat\-curses\fR.

Deprecated: 

Before WeeChat can run external scripts like inxi, you need to install the 
weechat\-plugins package. This is automatically installed for Debian users. 
Next, if you don't already have it, you need to install shell.py,
which is a python script. 

In a web browser, Click on the download button at:
.I https://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/shell.py.html/

Make the script executable by

.B chmod +x shell.py

Move it to your home folder: \fB/.weechat/python/autoload/\fR then logout, and start WeeChat with

.B weechat\-curses

Top of screen should say what pythons scripts have loaded, and should include shell. Then to run inxi, 
you would enter a command like this: 

.B /shell \-o inxi \-bx

If you leave off the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local weechat. WeeChat 
users may also like to check out the weeget.py
.SH INITIALIZATION FILE
inxi will read the following configuration/initialization files in the following order: 

\fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR is the default configurations. These can be overridden by user configurations
found in one of the following locations (inxi will place its config file using the following precedence
as well, that is, if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not empty, it will go there, else if \fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR
exists, it will go there, and as a last default, the legacy location is used:

\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf\fR or \fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR or \fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf\fR 

See wiki pages for more information on how to set these up:

.SH BUGS 
Please report bugs using the following resources. 

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool which will upload a data dump of all 
system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since 
they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

.SH  AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE
.B inxi
is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet very clever, infobash script. 

Original infobash author and copyright holder:
Copyright (C) 2005\-2007  Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif

inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008\-17 Harald Hope

Initial CPU logic, konversation version logic, and occasional 
maintenance fixes: Scott Rogers

Further fixes (listed as known): 

Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) \- usb audio patch; swap percent used patch.

Jarett.Stevens \- dmidecode \-M patch for older systems with no /sys 

And a special thanks to the nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux\-smokers\-club and #smxi,
who  all really have to be considered to be co\-developers because of their non\-stop enthusiasm 
and willingness to provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development. 

A further thanks to the Siduction forum members, who have helped get some features 
working by providing a lot of datasets that revealed possible variations, particularly 
for the ram  \fB\-m\fR option.

Further thanks to the various inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum
moderators, and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, which almost always
help make inxi better, and any others who contribute ideas, suggestions, and patches.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test on, we could 
never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning out to be.

And of course, big thanks locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, logic, 
and tricks used in inxi.

This Man page was originally created by Gordon Spencer (aka aus9) and is maintained by 
Harald Hope (aka h2 or TechAdmin).
