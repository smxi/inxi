All short form options have long form variants \- see below for these and more advanced options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinxi\fR is a command line system information script built for console
and IRC. It is also used a debugging tool for forum technical support
to quickly ascertain users' system configurations and hardware. inxi shows
system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, gcc version(s), Processes,
RAM usage, and a wide variety of other useful information.

\fBinxi\fR output varies depending on whether it is being used on CLI or IRC,
with some default filters and color options applied only for IRC use.
Script colors can be turned off if desired with \fB\-c 0\fR, or changed 
using the \fB\-c\fR color options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS section below.

.SH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi used on IRC automatically
filters out your network device MAC address, WAN and LAN IP, your \fB/home\fR
username directory in partitions, and a few other items.

Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this
filtering with the \fB\-z\fR option (\fB\-Fz\fR, for example). To override
the IRC filter, you can use the \fB\-Z\fR option. This can be useful in debugging
network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

.SH USING OPTIONS
Options can be combined if they do not conflict. You can either group the letters
together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion, except when
using \fB \-t\fR. Note that if you use an option that requires an additional
argument, that must be last in the short form group of options. Otherwise
you can use those separately as well.

For example:
\fBinxi \-AG\fR | \fBinxi \-A \-G\fR | \fBinxi \-b\fR | \fBinxi \-c10\fR 
| \fBinxi \-FxxzJy90\fR | \fBinxi \-bay\fR

Note that all the short form options have long form equivalents, which are
listed below. However, usually the short form is used in examples in order to
keep things simple.

.SH STANDARD OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-A\fR,\fB \-\-audio\fR
Show Audio/sound device(s) information, including device driver. Show running
sound server(s). See \fB\-xxA\fR to show all sound servers detected.

.TP
.B \-b\fR,\fB \-\-basic\fR
Show basic output, short form. Same as: \fBinxi \-v 2\fR

.TP
.B \-B\fR,\fB \-\-battery\fR
Show system battery (\fBID\-x\fR) data, charge, condition, plus extra information 
(if battery present). Uses \fB/sys\fR or, for BSDs without systctl battery data, 
\fBdmidecode\fR. \fBdmidecode\fR does not have very much information, and none 
about current battery state/charge/voltage. Supports multiple batteries when 
using \fB/sys\fR data.

Note that for \fBcharge:\fR, the output shows the current charge, as well as its
value as a percentage of the available capacity, which can be less than the original design
capacity. In the following example, the actual current available capacity of the battery
is \fB22.2 Wh\fR.

\fBcharge: 20.1 Wh (95.4%)\fR

The \fBcondition:\fR item shows the remaining available capacity / original design
capacity, and then this figure as a percentage of original capacity available in the battery.

\fBcondition: 22.2/36.4 Wh (61%)\fR

With \fB\-x\fR, or if voltage difference is critical, \fBvolts:\fR item shows the 
current voltage, and the \fBmin:\fR voltage. Note 
that if the current is below the minimum listed the battery is essentially dead
and will not charge. Test that to confirm, but that's technically how it's supposed to work.

\fBvolts: 12.0 min: 11.4\fR

With \fB\-x\fR shows attached \fBDevice\-x\fR information (mouse, keyboard, etc.) 
if they are battery powered.

.TP
.B \-\-bluetooth\fR \- See \fB\-E\fR

.TP
.B \-c\fR,\fB \-\-color\fR \fR[\fB0\fR\-\fB42\fR]
Set color scheme. If no scheme number is supplied, 0 is assumed.

.TP
.B \-c \fR[\fB94\fR\-\fB99\fR]

These color selectors run a color selector option  prior to inxi starting which lets
you set the config file value for the selection.

NOTE: All configuration file set color values are removed when output is 
piped or redirected. You must use the explicit runtime \fB\-c <color number>\fR option
if you want color codes to be present in the piped/redirected output.

Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: IRC and global only show safe color set):

.TP
.B \-c 94\fR
\- Console, out of X.

.TP
.B \-c 95\fR
\- Terminal, running in X \- like xTerm.

.TP
.B \-c 96\fR
\- GUI IRC, running in X \- like XChat, Quassel,
Konversation etc.

.TP
.B \-c 97\fR
\- Console IRC running in X \- like irssi in xTerm.

.TP
.B \-c 98\fR
\- Console IRC not in  X.

.TP
.B \-c 99\fR
\- Global \- Overrides/removes all settings.

Setting a specific color type removes the global color selection.

.TP
.B \-C\fR,\fB \-\-cpu\fR
Show full CPU output, including per CPU clock speed and CPU max speed (if available).
If max speed data present, shows \fB(max)\fR in short output formats (\fBinxi\fR,
\fBinxi \-b\fR) if actual CPU speed matches max CPU speed. If max CPU speed does
not match actual CPU speed, shows both actual and max speed information.
See \fB\-x\fR for more options.

For certain CPUs (some ARM, and AMD Zen family) shows CPU die count.

The details for each CPU include a technical description e.g. \fBtype: MT MCP\fR

* \fBMT\fR \- Multi/Hyper Threaded CPU, more than 1 thread per core (previously \fBHT\fR).

* \fBMCM\fR \- Multi Chip Model (more than 1 die per CPU).

* \fBMCP\fR \- Multi Core Processor (more than 1 core per CPU).

* \fBSMP\fR \- Symmetric Multi Processing (more than 1 physical CPU).

* \fBUP\fR \- Uni (single core) Processor.

Note that \fBmin/max:\fR speeds are not necessarily true in cases of overclocked CPUs
or CPUs in turbo/boost mode. See \fB\-Ca\fR for alternate \fBbase/boost:\fR speed data.

.TP
.B \-d\fR,\fB \-\-disk\-full\fR,\fB\-\-optical\fR
Show optical drive data as well as \fB\-D\fR hard drive data. With \fB\-x\fR, adds a
feature line to the output. Also shows floppy disks if present. Note that there is
no current way to get any information about the floppy device that we are aware of,
so it will simply show the floppy ID without any extra data. \fB\-xx\fR adds a
few more features.

.TP
.B \-D\fR,\fB \-\-disk\fR
Show Hard Disk info. Shows total disk space and used percentage. The disk used 
percentage includes space used by swap partition(s), since those are not usable 
for data storage. Also, unmounted partitions are not counted in disk use percentages 
since inxi has no access to the used amount.

If the system has RAID or other logical storage, and if inxi can determine 
the size of those vs their components, you will see the storage total raw and usable 
sizes, plus the percent used of the usable size. The no argument short form
of inxi will show only the usable (or total if no usable) and used percent.
If there is no logical storage detected, only \fBtotal:\fR and \fBused:\fR will
show. Sample (with RAID logical size calculated):

\fBLocal Storage: total: raw: 5.49 TiB usable: 2.80 TiB used: 1.35 TiB (48.3%)\fR

Without logical storage detected:

\fBLocal Storage: total: 2.89 TiB used: 1.51 TiB (52.3%)\fR

Also shows per disk information: Disk ID, type (if present), vendor (if detected), 
model, and size. See \fBExtra Data Options\fR (\fB\-x\fR options) and 
\fBAdmin Extra Data Options\fR (\fB\-\-admin\fR options) for many more features.

.TP
.B \-E\fR, \fB\-\-bluetooth\fR
Show bluetooth device(s), drivers. Show \fBReport:\fR (requires 
\fBbt\-adapter\fR or \fBhciconfig\fR) with HCI ID, state, address per device, 
and if available (hciconfig only) bluetooth version (\fBbt\-v\fR). 
See \fBExtra Data Options\fR for more. 

If bluetooth service is down or disabled, will show message.

Note that \fBReport\-ID:\fR indicates that the HCI item was not able to be linked to a 
specific device, similar to \fBIF\-ID:\fR in \fB\-n\fR.

If your internal bluetooth device does not show, it's possible that
it has been disabled, if you try enabling it using for example:

\fBhciconfig hci0 up\fR

and it returns a blocked by RF\-Kill error, you can do one of these:

\fBconnmanctl enable bluetooth\fR

or

\fBrfkill list bluetooth\fR

\fBrfkill unblock bluetooth\fR

.TP
.B \-\-filter\fR,\fB \-\-filter\-override\fR \- See \fB\-z\fR, \fB\-Z\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-filter\-label\fR
Filter partition label names from \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, 
\fB\-P\fR, and \fB\-Sa\fR (root=LABEL=...). Generally only useful in 
very specialized cases.

.TP
.B \-\-filter\-uuid\fR
Filter partition UUIDs from \fB\-j\fR, \fB\-o\fR, \fB\-p\fR, 
\fB\-P\fR, and \fB\-Sa\fR (root=UUID=...). Generally only useful in 
very specialized cases.

.TP
.B \-f\fR,\fB \-\-flags\fR
Show all CPU flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR in order
to avoid spamming. ARM CPUs: show \fBfeatures\fR items.

.TP
.B \-F\fR,\fB \-\-full\fR
Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters (except \fB\-J\fR 
and \fB\-W\fR) plus \fB\-\-swap\fR, \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-n\fR. Does not show extra
verbose options such as \fB\-d \-f \-i -J \-l \-m \-o \-p \-r \-t \-u \-x\fR unless 
you use those arguments in the command, e.g.: \fBinxi \-Frmxx\fR

.TP
.B \-G\fR,\fB \-\-graphics\fR
Show Graphic device(s) information, including details of device and display drivers
(\fBloaded:\fR, and, if applicable: \fBunloaded:\fR, \fBfailed:\fR),
display protocol (if available), display server (and/or Wayland compositor), 
vendor and version number, e.g.:

\fBDisplay: x11 server: Xorg 1.15.1\fR

If protocol is not detected, shows:

\fBDisplay: server: Xorg 1.15.1\fR

Also shows screen resolution(s) (per monitor/X screen), OpenGL renderer, 
OpenGL core profile version/OpenGL version.

Compositor information will show if detected using \fB\-xx\fR option
or always if detected and Wayland.

.TP
.B \-h\fR,\fB \-\-help\fR
The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set script
global \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR if you want a different default value, or
use \fB\-y <width>\fR to temporarily override the defaults or actual window width.

.TP
.B \-i\fR,\fB \-\-ip\fR
Show WAN IP address and local interfaces (latter requires \fBifconfig\fR or
\fBip\fR network tool), as well as network output from \fB\-n\fR.
Not shown with \fB\-F\fR for user security reasons. You shouldn't paste your
local/WAN IP. Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP addresses.

.TP
.B \-I\fR,\fB \-\-info\fR
Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, IRC client (or shell type if run in
shell, not IRC), inxi version. See \fB\-Ix\fR, \fB\-Ixx\fR, and \fB\-Ia\fR
for extra information (init type/version, runlevel, packages). 

Note: if \fB\-m\fR is used or triggered, the memory item will show in the main
Memory: report of \fB\-m\fR, not in \fB\Info:\fR.

Rasberry Pi only: uses \fBvcgencmd get_mem gpu\fR to get gpu RAM amount, 
if user is in video group and \fBvcgencmd\fR is installed. Uses 
this result to increase the \fBMemory:\fR amount and \fBused:\fR amounts.

.TP
.B \-j\fR, \fB\-\-swap\fR
Shows all active swap types (partition, file, zram). When this option is used,
swap partition(s) will not show on the \fB\-P\fR line to avoid redundancy.

.TP
.B \-J\fR,\fB \-\-usb\fR
Show USB data for attached Hubs and Devices. Hubs also show number of ports. 
Be aware that a port is not always external, some may be internal, and either
used or unused (for example, a motherboard USB header connector that is not used).

Hubs and Devices are listed in order of BusID.

BusID is generally in this format: BusID\-port[.port][.port]:DeviceID

Device ID is a number created by the kernel, and has no necessary ordering
or sequence connection, but can be used to match this output to lsusb
values, which generally shows BusID / DeviceID (except for tree view, which
shows ports).

Examples: \fBDevice\-3: 4\-3.2.1:2\fR or \fBHub: 4\-0:1\fR

The \fBrev: 2.0\fR item refers to the USB revision number, like \fB1.0\fR or
\fB3.1\fR.

.TP
.B \-l\fR,\fB \-\-label\fR
Show partition labels. Default: main partitions \fB\-P\fR. For full \fB\-p\fR output,
use: \fB\-pl\fR.

.TP
.B \-L\fR, \fB\-\-logical\fR
Show Logical volume information, for LVM, LUKS, bcache, etc. Shows
size, free space (for LVM VG). For LVM, shows \fBDevice\-[xx]: VG:\fR 
(Volume Group) size/free, \fBLV\-[xx]\fR (Logical Volume). LV shows type, 
size, and components. Note that components are made up of either containers
(aka, logical devices), or physical devices. The full report requires 
doas[BSDs]/sudo/root.

Logical block devices can be thought of as devices that are made up out
of either other logical devices, or physical devices. inxi does its best 
to show what each logical device is made out of. RAID devices form a subset
of all possible Logical devices, but have their own section, \fB\-R\fR. 

If \fB\-R\fR is used with \fB\-Lxx\fR, \fB\-Lxx\fR will not show RAID 
information for LVM RAID devices since it's redundant. If \fB\-R\fR is
not used, a simple RAID line will appear for LVM RAID in \fB\-Lxx\fR.

\fB\-Lxx\fR also shows all components and devices. Note that since
components can go in many levels, each level per primary component is
indicated by either another 'c', or ends with a 'p' device, the physical
device. The number of c's or p's indicates the depth, so you can see which
component belongs to which.

\fB\-L\fR shows only the top level components/devices (like \fB\-R\fR).
\fB\-La\fR shows component/device size, maj:min ID, mapped name
(if applicable), and puts each component/device on its own line.

Sample:

\fBDevice\-10: mybackup type: LUKS dm: dm\-28 size: 6.36 GiB Components: c\-1: md1 
cc\-1: dm\-26 ppp\-1: sdj2 cc\-2: dm\-27 ppp\-1: sdk2\fR

.nf
\fBLV\-5: lvm_raid1 type: raid1 dm: dm\-16 size: 4.88 GiB 
RAID: stripes: 2 sync: idle copied: 100% mismatches: 0 
Components: c\-1: dm\-10 pp\-1: sdd1 c\-2: dm\-11 pp\-1: sdd1 c\-3: dm\-13 
pp\-1: sde1 c\-4: dm\-15 pp\-1: sde1\fR
.fi

It is easier to follow the flow of components and devices using \fB\-y1\fR. In
this example, there is one primary component (c\-1), md1, which is made up of two
components (cc\-1,2), dm\-26 and dm\-27. These are respectively made from physical
devices (p\-1) sdj2 and sdk2.

.nf
\fBDevice\-10: mybackup
  maj\-min: 254:28
  type: LUKS
  dm: dm\-28
  size: 6.36 GiB
  Components: 
    c\-1: md1
    maj\-min: 9:1
    size: 6.37 GiB
    cc\-1: dm\-26
      maj\-min: 254:26
      mapped: vg5\-level1a
      size: 12.28 GiB
      ppp\-1: sdj2
        maj\-min: 8:146
        size: 12.79 GiB
    cc\-2: dm\-27
      maj\-min: 254:27
      mapped: vg5\-level1b
      size: 6.38 GiB
      ppp\-1: sdk2
        maj\-min: 8:162
        size: 12.79 GiB\fR
.fi

Other types of logical block handling like LUKS, bcache show as:

\fBDevice\-[xx] [name/id] type: [LUKS|Crypto|bcache]:\fR

.TP
.B \-m\fR,\fB \-\-memory\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Does not display with  \fB\-b\fR or  \fB\-F\fR unless you use \fB\-m\fR
explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) (\fBArray\-[number]\fR),
and individual memory devices (\fBDevice\-[number]\fR). Physical memory
array  data shows array capacity, number of devices supported, and Error Correction
information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax), size, speed,
type (eg: \fBtype: DDR3\fR).

Note: \fB\-m\fR uses \fBdmidecode\fR, which must be run as root (or start
\fBinxi\fR with \fBsudo\fR), unless you figure out how to set up doas[BSDs]/sudo
to permit dmidecode to read \fB/dev/mem\fR as user. \fBspeed\fR and \fBbus\-width\fR 
will not show if \fBNo Module Installed\fR is found in \fBsize\fR.

Note: If \fB\-m\fR is triggered RAM total/used report will appear in this section, 
not in \fB\-I\fR or \fB\-tm\fR items.

Because \fBdmidecode\fR data is extremely unreliable, inxi will try to make best guesses.
If you see \fB(check)\fR after the capacity number, you should check it with the
specifications. \fB(est)\fR is slightly more reliable, but you should still check
the real specifications before buying RAM. Unfortunately there is nothing \fBinxi\fR
can do to get truly reliable data about the system RAM; maybe one day the kernel devs
will put this data into \fB/sys\fR, and make it real data, taken from the actual system,
not dmi data. For most people, the data will be right, but a significant percentage of
users will have either a wrong max module size, if present, or max capacity.

Under dmidecode, \fBSpeed:\fR is the expected speed of the memory 
(what is advertised on the memory spec sheet) and \fBConfigured Clock Speed:\fR
is what the actual speed is now. To handle this, if speed and configured speed values
are different, you will see this instead:

\fBspeed: spec: [specified speed] MT/S actual: [actual] MT/S\fR

Also, if DDR, and speed in MHz, will change to: \fBspeed: [speed] MT/S ([speed] MHz)\fR

If the detected speed is logically absurd, like 1 MT/s or 69910 MT/s, adds: 
\fBnote: check\fR. Sample:

.nf
\fBMemory:
  RAM: total: 31.38 GiB used: 20.65 GiB (65.8%) 
  Array\-1: capacity: N/A slots: 4 note: check EC: N/A 
  Device\-1: DIMM_A1 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device\-2: DIMM_A2 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  actual: 61910 MT/s (30955 MHz) note: check 
  Device\-3: DIMM_B1 size: 8 GiB speed: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  Device\-4: DIMM_B2 size: 8 GiB speed: spec: 1600 MT/s (800 MHz) 
  actual: 2 MT/s (1 MHz) note: check\fR
.fi

See \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR and \fB\-\-memory\-short\fR if you want a shorter report.

.TP
.B \-\-memory\-modules\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Show only RAM arrays and modules in Memory report. 
Skip empty slots. See \fB\-m\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-memory\-short\fR
Memory (RAM) data. Show a one line RAM report in Memory. See \fB\-m\fR.

Sample: \fBReport: arrays: 1 slots: 4 modules: 2 type: DDR4\fR

.TP
.B \-M\fR,\fB \-\-machine\fR
Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, BIOS, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo).
Older systems/kernels without the required \fB/sys\fR data can use \fBdmidecode\fR instead, run
as root. If using \fBdmidecode\fR, may also show BIOS/UEFI revision as well as version.
\fB\-\-dmidecode\fR forces use of \fBdmidecode\fR data instead of \fB/sys\fR.
Will also attempt to show if the system was booted by BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy], the
latter being legacy BIOS boot mode in a system board using UEFI.

Device information requires either \fB/sys\fR or \fBdmidecode\fR. Note that 'other\-vm?'
is a type that means it's usually a VM, but inxi failed to detect which type, or
positively confirm which VM it is. Primary VM identification is via systemd\-detect\-virt
but fallback tests that should also support some BSDs are used. Less commonly
used or harder to detect VMs may not be correctly detected. If you get an incorrect output,
post an issue and we'll get it fixed if possible.

Due to unreliable vendor data, device type will show: desktop, laptop, notebook, server,
blade, plus some obscure stuff that inxi is unlikely to ever run on.

.TP
.B \-n\fR,\fB \-\-network\-advanced\fR
Show Advanced Network device information in addition to that produced by \fB\-N\fR.
Shows interface, speed, MAC ID, state, etc.

.TP
.B \-N\fR,\fB \-\-network\fR
Show Network device(s) information, including device driver. With \fB\-x\fR, shows Bus ID, 
Port number.

.TP
.B \-o\fR,\fB \-\-unmounted\fR
Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).
Shows file system type if you have \fBlsblk\fR installed (Linux only). For BSD/GNU Linux:
shows file system type if \fBfile\fR is installed, and if you are root or
if you have added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

BSD users: see \fBman doas.conf\fR for setup.

Does not show components (partitions that create the md\-raid array) of md\-raid arrays.

.TP
.B \-p\fR,\fB \-\-partitions\-full\fR
Show full Partition information (\fB\-P\fR plus all other detected mounted partitions).

.TP
.B \-P\fR,\fB \-\-partitions\fR
Show basic Partition information.
Shows, if detected: \fB/ /boot /boot/efi /home /opt /tmp /usr /usr/home /var /var/tmp 
/var/log\fR (for android, shows \fB/cache /data /firmware /system\fR).
If \fB\-\-swap\fR is not used, shows active swap partitions (never shows file or 
zram type swap). 
Use \fB\-p\fR to see all mounted partitions.

.TP
.B \-\-processes\fR \- See \fB\-t\fR

.TP
.B \-r\fR,\fB \-\-repos\fR
Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

\fBSLACKPKG\fR (Slackware + derived versions)

\fBTCE\fR (TinyCore)

\fBURPMI\fR (Mandriva, Mageia + derived versions)

\fBXBPS\fR (Void)

\fBYUM/ZYPP\fR (Fedora, Red Hat, Suse + derived versions)

More will be added as distro data is collected. If yours is missing please
show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.

See \fB\-rx\fR, \fB\-rxx\fR, and \fB\-ra\fR for installed package count information.

.TP
.B \-R\fR,\fB \-\-raid\fR
Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, device/array size,
and components. See extra data with \fB\-x\fR / \fB\-xx\fR.

md\-raid: If device is resyncing, also shows resync progress line.

Note: Only md\-raid, ZFS and hardware RAID are currently supported. 
Other software RAID types may be added, if the software
RAID actually can be made to give the required output.

The component ID numbers work like this: mdraid: the numerator
is the actual mdraid component number; ZFS: the numerator is
auto\-incremented counter only. Eg. \fBOnline: 1: sdb1\fR

If hardware RAID is detected, shows basic information. Due to complexity
of adding hardware RAID device disk / RAID reports, those will only be added 
if there is demand, and reasonable reporting tools. 

.TP
.B \-\-recommends\fR
Checks inxi application dependencies and recommends, as well as directories,
then shows what package(s) you need to install to add support for each feature.

.TP
.B \-s\fR,\fB \-\-sensors\fR
Show output from sensors if sensors installed/configured: Motherboard/CPU/GPU
temperatures; detected fan speeds. GPU temperature when available. Nvidia shows
screen number for multiple screens. IPMI sensors are also used (root required)
if present. See Advanced options \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR or 
\fB\-\-sensors\-exclude\fR if you want to use only a subset of all sensors, or
exclude one.
.
.TP
.B \-\-slots\fR
Show PCI slots with type, speed, and status information.

.TP
.B \-\-swap\fR \- See \fB\-j\fR

If inxi \fB\-h\fR has no listing for \fB\-U\fR then it's disabled.

Auto\-update script. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root to
update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this man page to:
\fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR (if \fB/usr/local/share/man/\fR exists
AND there is no inxi man page in \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR, otherwise it
goes to \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR). This requires that you be root to write

Useful for testing output and to see what data you can get from your system.

.TP
.B \-w\fR,\fB \-\-weather\fR
Adds weather line. To get weather for an alternate location, use
\fB\-W [location]\fR. See also \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR options.
Please note that your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature.

DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! You will be blocked 
from any further access. This feature is not meant for widget type 
weather monitoring, or Conky type use. It is meant to get weather when you need to 
see it, for example, on a remote server.

.TP
.B \-W\fR, \fB\-\-weather\-location <location_string>\fR
Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code[, country],
city,state pair, or latitude,longitude. Note: city/country/state names must not
contain spaces. Replace spaces with '\fB+\fR' sign. Don't place spaces around 
any commas. Postal code is not reliable except for North America and maybe the UK.
Try postal codes with and without country code added. Note that City,State applies 
only to USA, otherwise it's City,Country. If country name (english) does not work,
try 2 character country code (e.g. Spain: es; Great Britain: gb). 

See \fIhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166\-1_alpha\-2\fR for current 2 letter 
country codes.

Use only ASCII letters in city/state/country names.

Examples: \fB\-W 95623,us\fR OR \fB\-W Boston,MA\fR OR 
\fB\-W 45.5234,\-122.6762\fR OR \fB\-W new+york,ny\fR OR \fB\-W bodo,norway\fR.

DO NOT USE THIS FEATURE FOR AUTOMATED WEATHER UPDATES! Use of automated queries, 
will result in your access being blocked. If you try to work around the ban, you 
will be permanently banned from this service.

.TP
.B \-\-weather\-source\fR, \fB\-\-ws <unit>\fR
[\fB1\-9\fR] Switches weather data source. Possible values are \fB1\-9\fR. \fB1\-4\fR
will generally be active, and \fB5\-9\fR may or may not be active, so check.
\fB1\fR may not support city / country names with spaces (even if you use the \fB+\fR
sign instead of space). \fB2\fR offers pretty good data, but may not have all small 
city names for \fB\-W\fR. 

Please note that the data sources are not static per value, and can change any time, 
or be removed, so always test to verify which source is being used for each value 
if that is important to you. Data sources may be added or removed on occasions, so 
try each one and see which you prefer. If you get unsupported source message, it means 
that number has not been implemented.

.TP
.B \-\-weather\-unit <unit>\fR
[\fBm\fR|\fBi\fR|\fBmi\fR|\fBim\fR] Sets weather units to metric (\fBm\fR), imperial (\fBi\fR), 
metric (imperial) (\fBmi\fR, default), imperial (metric) (\fBim\fR). If metric or imperial 
not found,sets to default value, or \fBN/A\fR.

.TP
.B \-y\fR,\fB \-\-width [integer]\fR
This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max.
Overrides \fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR / \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR globals, or the
actual widths of the terminal. \fB80\fR is the minimum width supported. 
\fB\-1\fR removes width limits. 1 switches to a single indented key/value 
pair per line, and removes all long line wrapping (similar to 
\fBdmidecode\fR output).

If no integer value is given, sets width to default of 80. 

Examples: \fBinxi \-Fxx\ \-y 130\fR or \fBinxi \-Fxxy\fR or \fBinxi \-bay1\fR

.TP
.B \-z\fR,\fB \-\-filter\fR
Adds security filters for IP addresses, serial numbers, MAC, 
location (\fB\-w\fR), and user home directory name. Removes Host:.
On by default for IRC clients.

.TP
.B \-Z\fR,\fB \-\-filter\-override\fR
Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking
issues in IRC for example.

.SH EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options can be triggered by one or more \fB\-x\fR.
Alternatively, the \fB\-v\fR options trigger them in the following
way: \fB\-v 3\fR adds \fB\-x\fR;
\fB\-v 6\fR adds \fB\-xx\fR; \fB\-v 7\fR adds \fB\-xxx\fR

These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in\-depth
data on various options. They can be added to any long form option list,
e.g.: \fB\-bxx\fR or \fB\-Sxxx\fR

There are 3 extra data levels:

\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR

OR

\fB\-\-extra 1\fR, \fB\-\-extra 2\fR, \fB\-\-extra 3\fR

The following details show which lines / items display extra information for each
extra data level.

.TP
.B \-x \-A\fR
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each device.

\- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

\- Adds non-running sound servers, if detected.

.TP
.B \-x \-B\fR
\- Adds vendor/model, battery status (if battery present).

\- Adds attached battery powered peripherals (\fBDevice\-[number]:\fR) if 
detected (keyboard, mouse, etc.).

\- Adds battery \fBvolts:\fR, \fBmin:\fR voltages. Note that if difference 
is critical, that is current voltage is too close to minimum voltage, shows 
without \fB\-x\fR.

.TP
.B \-x \-C\fR
\- Adds bogomips on CPU (if available)

\- Adds \fBboost: [enabled|disabled]\fR if detected, aka \fBturbo\fR. Not all CPUs 
have this feature.

\- Adds CPU Flags (short list). Use \fB\-f\fR to see full flag/feature list.

\- Adds CPU microarchitecture + revision (e.g. Sandy Bridge, K8, ARMv8, P6,
etc.). Only shows data if detected. Newer microarchitectures will have
to be added as they appear, and require the CPU family ID, model ID,
and stepping.

Examples: \fBarch: Sandy Bridge rev: 2\fR, \fBarch: K8 rev.F+ rev: 2\fR

If unable to non\-ambiguosly determine architecture, will show something like:
\fBarch: Amber Lake note: check rev: 9\fR

.TP
.B \-x \-d\fR
\- Adds more items to \fBFeatures\fR line of optical drive; 
dds rev version to optical drive.

.TP
.B \-x \-D\fR
\- Adds HDD temperature with disk data.

Method 1: Systems running Linux kernels ~5.6 and newer should have \fBdrivetemp\fR
module data available. If so, drive temps will come from /sys data for each drive, 
and will not require root or hddtemp. This method is MUCH faster than using hddtemp.
Note that NVMe drives do not require \fBdrivetemp\fR.

If your \fBdrivetemp\fR module is not enabled, enable it:

\fBmodprobe drivetemp\fR

Once enabled, add \fBdrivetemp\fR to \fB/etc/modules\fR or 
\fB/etc/modules\-load.d/***.conf\fR so it starts automatically. 

If you see drive temps running as regular user and you did not configure system 
to use doas[BSDs]/sudo hddtemp, then your system supports this feature. If no /sys 
data is found, inxi will try to use hddtemp methods instead for that drive. 
Hint: if temp is /sys sourced, the temp will be to 1 decimal, like 34.8, if hddtemp 
sourced, they will be integers.

Method 2: if you have hddtemp installed, if you are root
or if you have added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer):

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/hddtemp (sample)

BSD users: see \fBman doas.conf\fR for setup.

You can force use of \fBhddtemp\fR for all drives using \fB\-\-hddtemp\fR. 

\- If free LVM volume group size detected (root required), show \fBlvm-free:\fR
on Local Storage line. This is how much unused space the VGs contain, that is,
space not assigned to LVs.

.TP
.B \-x \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- Adds PCI/USB Bus ID of each device.

\- Adds driver version (if available) for each device.

\- Adds (if available, and \fBhciconfig\fR only) LMP (HCI if no LMP data, 
and HCI if HCI/LMP versions are different) version (if available) 
for each HCI ID.

.TP
.B \-x \-G\fR
\- Adds (if available and/or relevant) \fBvendor:\fR item, which shows 
specific vendor [product] information.

\- Adds direct rendering status.

\- Adds (for single GPU, nvidia driver) screen number that GPU is running on.

\- Adds PCI/USB ID of each device.

.TP
.B \-x \-i\fR
\- Adds IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for
each interface.

Note that there is no way we are aware of to filter out the deprecated
IP v6 scope site/global temporary addresses from the output of
\fBifconfig\fR. The \fBip\fR tool shows that clearly.

\fBip\-v6\-temporary\fR \- (\fBip\fR tool only), scope global temporary.
Scope global temporary deprecated is not shown

\fBip\-v6\-global\fR \- scope global (\fBifconfig\fR will show this for
all types, global, global temporary, and global temporary deprecated,
\fBip\fR shows it only for global)

\fBip\-v6\-link\fR \- scope link (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR) \- default
for \fB\-i\fR.

\fBip\-v6\-site\fR \- scope site (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR). This has been
deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. \fBifconfig\fR may show multiple site
values, as with global temporary, and global temporary deprecated.

\fBip\-v6\-unknown\fR \- unknown scope

.TP
.B \-x \-I\fR
\- Adds current init system (and init rc in some cases, like OpenRC).
With \fB\-xx\fR, shows init/rc version number, if available.

\- Adds default system gcc. With \fB\-xx\fR, also show other installed gcc
versions.

\- Adds current runlevel (not available with all init systems).

\- Adds total packages discovered in system. See \fB\-xx\fR and \fB\-a\fR
for per package manager types output. Moves to \fBRepos\fR if \fB\-rx\fR.

If your package manager is not supported, please file an issue and we'll add it. 
That requires the full output of the query or method to discover all installed 
packages on your system, as well of course as the command or method used to 
discover those.

\- If in shell (i.e. not in IRC client), adds shell version number, if available.

.TP
.B \-x \-j\fR, \fB\-x \-\-swap\fR
Add \fBmapper:\fR. See \fB\-x \-o\fR.

.TP
.B \-x \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- For Devices, adds driver(s).

.TP
.B \-x \-L\fR, \fB\-x \-\-logical\fR
\- Adds \fBdm: dm-x\fR to VG > LV and other Device types. This can help tracking 
down which device belongs to what.

.TP
.B \-x \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- If present, adds maximum memory module/device size in the Array line.
Only some systems will have this data available. Shows estimate if it can
generate one.

\- Hardware RAID: Adds driver version, Bus ID.

.TP
.B \-x \-s\fR
\- Adds basic voltages: 12v, 5v, 3.3v, vbat (\fBipmi\fR, \fBlm-sensors\fR if present).

.TP
.B \-x \-S\fR
\- Adds Kernel gcc version.

\- Adds to \fBDistro:\fR \fBbase:\fR if detected. System base will only be seen on
a subset of distributions. The distro must be both derived from a parent distro (e.g. Mint from 
Ubuntu), and explicitly added to the supported distributions for this feature. Due to 
the complexity of distribution identification, these will only be added as relatively solid
methods are found for each distribution system base detection.

.TP
.B \-x \-t\fR (\fB\-\-processes\fR)
\- Adds memory use output to CPU (\fB\-xt c\fR), and CPU use to memory
(\fB\-xt m\fR).

.TP
.B \-x \-w\fR,\fB \-W\fR
\- Adds humidity and barometric pressure.

\- Adds wind speed and direction.

.TP
.B \-xx \-A\fR
\- Adds vendor:product ID for each device.

.TP
.B \-xx \-B\fR
\- Adds serial number.

.TP
.B \-xx \-C\fR
\- Adds \fBL1\-cache:\fR and \fBL3\-cache:\fR if either are available. Requires 
dmidecode and doas[BSDs]/sudo/root.

.TP
.B \-xx \-D\fR
\- Adds disk serial number.

\- Adds disk speed (if available). This is the theoretical top speed of the 
device as reported. This speed may be restricted by system board limits, eg. 
a SATA 3 drive on a SATA 2 board may report SATA 2 speeds, but this is not 
completely consistent, sometimes a SATA 3 device on a SATA 2 board reports
its design speed.

NVMe drives: adds lanes, and (per direction) speed is calculated with 
lane speed * lanes * PCIe overhead. PCIe 1 and 2 have data rates of 
GT/s * .8  = Gb/s (10 bits required to transfer 8 bits of data). 
PCIe 3 and greater transfer data at a rate of GT/s * 128/130 * lanes = Gb/s 
(130 bits required to transfer 128 bits of data).

For a PCIe 3 NVMe drive, with speed of \fB8 GT/s\fR and \fB4\fR lanes 
(\fB8GT/s * 128/130 * 4 = 31.6 Gb/s\fR): 

\fBspeed: 31.6 Gb/s lanes: 4\fR

.TP
.B \-xx \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

\- Adds (\fBhciconfig \fRonly) LMP subversion (and/or HCI revision 
if applicable) for each device.

.TP
.B \-xx \-G\fR
\- Adds vendor:product ID of each device.

\- Adds Xorg compositor, if found (always shows for Wayland systems).

\- For free drivers, adds OpenGL compatibility version number if  available.
For nonfree drivers, the core version and compatibility versions are usually
the same. Example:

\fBv: 3.3 Mesa 11.2.0 compat\-v: 3.0\fR

\- If available, shows \fBalternate:\fR Xorg drivers. This means a driver on 
the default list of drivers Xorg automatically checks for the device, but which 
is not installed. For example, if you have \fBnouveau\fR driver, \fBnvidia\fR would 
show as alternate if it was not installed. Note that \fBalternate:\fR does NOT mean you 
should have it, it's just one of the drivers Xorg checks to see if is present 
and loaded when checking the device. This can let you know there are other driver options.
Note that if you have explicitly set the driver in \fBxorg.conf\fR, Xorg will not 
create this automatic check driver list.

\- If available, shows Xorg dpi (\fBs-dpi:\fR) for the active Xorg \fBScreen\fR
(not physical monitor). Note that the physical monitor dpi and the Xorg 
dpi are not necessarily the same thing, and can vary widely.

.TP
.B \-xx \-I\fR
\- Adds init type version number (and rc if present).

\- Adds other detected installed gcc versions (if present).

\- Adds system default runlevel, if detected. Supports Systemd/Upstart/SysVinit
type defaults.

\- Shows \fBPackages:\fR counts by discovered package manager types. In cases where
only 1 type had results, does not show total after \fBPackages:\fR. Does not
show installed package managers wtih 0 packages. See \fB\-a\fR for full output.
Moves to \fBRepos\fR if \fB\-rxx\fR.

\- Adds parent program (or tty) that started shell, if not IRC client.

.TP
.B \-xx \-j\fR (\fB\-\-swap\fR), \fB\-xx \-p\fR, \fB\-xx \-P\fR
\- Adds swap priority to each swap partition (for \fB\-P\fR) used, and for all
swap types (for \fB\-j\fR).

.TP
.B \-xx \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- Adds vendor:chip id.

.TP
.B \-xx \-L\fR, \fB\-xx \-\-logical\fR
\- Adds internal LVM Logical volumes, like raid image and meta data volumes. 

\- Adds full list of Components, sub\-components, and their physical devices.

\- For LVM RAID, adds a RAID report line (if not \fB\-R\fR). Read up on LVM
documentation to better understand their use of the term 'stripes'.

.TP
.B \-xx \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- Adds memory device Manufacturer.

\- Adds  memory device Part Number (\fBpart\-no:\fR). Useful for ordering new or
replacement memory sticks etc. Part numbers are unique, particularly
if you use the word \fBmemory\fR in the search as well. With \fB\-xxx\fR,
also shows serial number.

\- Adds single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may not be 100% right
all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found in \fBdmidecode\fR
output for \fBtype 6\fR and \fBtype 17\fR.

.TP
.B \-xx \-M\fR
\- Adds chassis information, if data is available. Also shows BIOS
ROM size if using \fBdmidecode\fR.

.B \-xx \-s\fR
\- Adds DIMM/SOC voltages, if present (\fBipmi\fR only).

.TP
.B \-xx \-S\fR

Supports most known display managers, including gdm, gdm3,
idm, kdm, lightdm, lxdm, mdm, nodm, sddm, slim, tint, wdm, and xdm.

\- Adds, if run in X, window manager type (\fBwm\fR), if available.
Not all window managers are supported. Some desktops support using more than one
window manager, so this can be useful to see what window manager is actually running.
If none found, shows nothing. Uses a less accurate fallback tool \fBwmctrl\fR 
if \fBps\fR tests fail to find data.

\- Adds desktop toolkit (\fBtk\fR), if available (Xfce/KDE/Trinity).

.TP
.B \-xx \-\-slots\fR

.TP
.B \-xxx \-B\fR
\- Adds battery chemistry (e.g. \fBLi\-ion\fR), cycles (NOTE: there appears to
be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the cycle count, so this almost
always shows \fB0\fR. There's nothing that can be done about this glitch, the
data is simply not available as of 2018\-04\-03), location (only available from
\fBdmidecode\fR derived output).

\- Adds attached device \fBrechargeable: [yes|no]\fR information. 

.TP
.B \-xxx \-C\fR
\- Adds CPU voltage and external clock speed (this is the motherboard speed). 
Requires doas[BSDs]/sudo/root and \fBdmidecode\fR.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-D\fR
\- Adds disk firmware revision number (if available).

\- Adds disk partition scheme (in most cases), e.g. \fBscheme: GPT\fR. Currently not 
able to detect all schemes, but handles the most common, e.g. \fBGPT\fR or \fBMBR\fR.

\- Adds disk rotation speed (in some but not all cases), e.g. \fBrotation: 7200 rpm\fR
or \fBrotation: SSD\fR if positive SSD identification was made. If no rotation or positive 
SSD ID found, nothing shows. Not all disks report this speed, so even if they are spinnning,
no data will show.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

\- Adds (\fBhciconfig \fRonly) HCI version, revision.

uses the \fBwhoami\fR test.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-J\fR (\fB\-\-usb\fR)
\- Adds, if present, serial number for non hub devices.

\- Adds \fBinterfaces:\fR for non hub devices.

\- Adds, if available, USB speed in \fBMbits/s\fR or \fBGbits/s\fR.

\- Adds, if non 0, max power in mA.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\-modules\fR
\- Adds memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. e.g.
\fBbus width: 64 bit (total: 72 bits)\fR. Note that total / data widths are mixed up
sometimes in dmidecode output, so inxi will take the larger value as the total if
present. If no total width data is found, then inxi will not show that item.

\- Adds device Type Detail, e.g. \fBdetail: DDR3 (Synchronous)\fR.

\- Adds, if present, memory module voltage. Only some systems will have this
data available.

\- Adds device serial number.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-N\fR
\- Adds, if present, serial number.

\- Adds, if present, PCI/USB class ID.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-R\fR
\- md\-raid: Adds system mdraid support types (kernel support, read ahead, RAID events)

\- zfs\-raid: Adds portion allocated (used) by RAID array/device.

\- Hardware RAID: Adds rev, ports, and (if available and/or relevant) 
\fBvendor:\fR item, which shows specific vendor [product] information.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-S\fR
\- Adds, if in X, or with \fB--display\fR, bar/dock/panel/tray items 
(\fBinfo\fR). If none found, shows nothing. Supports desktop items like gnome\-panel,
lxpanel, xfce4\-panel, lxqt\-panel, tint2, cairo-dock, trayer, and many others. 

\- Adds (if present), window manager (\fBwm\fR) version number.

\- Adds (if present), display manager (\fBdm\fR) version number.

\- Adds (if Linux, systemd, and in display), virtual terminal (\fBvt\fR) number.
These are the same as \fBctrl+alt+F[x]\fR numbers usually.

.TP
.B \-xxx \-w\fR,\fB \-W\fR
\- Adds location (city state country), observation altitude (if available), 
weather observation time (if available), sunset/sunrise (if available).

.SH ADMIN EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options are triggered with \fB\-\-admin\fR or \fB\-a\fR. Admin options are 
advanced output options, and are more technical, and mostly of interest to system 
administrators or other machine admins. 

The \fB\-\-admin\fR option sets \fB\-xxx\fR, and only has to be used once.
It will trigger the following features:

.TP
.B \-a \-A\fR
\- Adds, if present, possible \fBalternate:\fR kernel modules capable of driving 
each \fBDevice\-x\fR (not including the current \fBdriver:\fR). If no non\-driver 
modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module does NOT mean it is
available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used 
instead. 

.TP
.B \-a \-C\fR
\- Adds CPU family, model\-id, and stepping (replaces \fBrev\fR of \fB\-Cx\fR). 
Format is \fBhexadecimal (decimal)\fR if greater than 9, otherwise \fBhexadecimal\fR. 

\- Adds CPU microcode. Format is \fBhexadecimal\fR.

\- Adds socket type (for motherboard CPU socket, if available). If results doubtful
will list two socket types and \fBnote: check\fR. Requires doas[BSDs]/sudo/root and 
\fBdmidecode\fR. The item in parentheses may simply be a different syntax for the 
same socket, but in general, check this before trusting it.
.nf
Sample: \fBsocket: 775 (478) note: check\fR
Sample: \fBsocket: AM4\fR
.fi

\- Adds DMI CPU base and boost/turbo speeds. Requires doas[BSDs]/sudo/root and 
\fBdmidecode\fR. In some cases, like with overclocking or 'turbo' or 'boost' modes, 
voltage and external clock speeds may be increased, or short term limits raised 
on max CPU speeds. These are often not reflected in /sys based CPU \fBmin/max:\fR 
speed results, but often are using this source.

Samples:
.nf
CPU not overclocked, with boost, like Ryzen:
\fBSpeed: 2861 MHz min/max: 1550/3400 MHz boost: enabled base/boost: 3400/3900\fR 

Overclocked 2900 MHz CPU, with no boost available: 
\fBSpeed: 2900 MHz min/max: 800/2900 MHz base/boost: 3350/3000\fR

Overclocked 3000 MHz CPU, with boosted max speed:
\fBSpeed: 4190 MHz min/max: 1200/3001 MHz base/boost: 3000/4000\fR
.fi

Note that these numbers can be confusing, but basically, the \fBbase\fR
number is the actual normal top speed the CPU runs at without boost mode, and the 
\fBboost\fR number is the max speed the CPU reports itself able to run at. 
The actual max speed may be higher than either value, or lower. 
The \fBboost\fR number appears to be hard\-coded into the CPU DMI data, 
and does not seem to reflect actual max speeds that overclocking or 
other combinations of speed boosters can enable, as you can see from the 
example where the CPU is running at a speed faster than
the min/max or base/boost values.

Note that the normal \fBmin/max:\fR speeds do NOT show actual overclocked OR
boost/turbo mode speeds, and appear to be hard\-coded values, not dynamic real
values. The \fBbase/boost:\fR values are sometimes real, and sometimes not. 
\fBbase\fR appears in general to be real.

\- Adds CPU Vulnerabilities (bugs) as known by your current kernel. Lists by
\fBType: ... (status|mitigation): ....\fR for systems that support this feature 
(Linux kernel 4.14 or newer, or patched older kernels).

.TP
.B \-a \-d\fR,\fB\-a \-D\fR
\- Adds logical and physical block size in bytes. 

Using \fBsmartctl\fR (requires doas[BSDs]/sudo/root privileges). 

\- Adds device model family, like \fBCaviar Black\fR, if available.

\- Adds SATA type (eg 1.0, 2.6, 3.0) if a SATA device.

\- Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

\- Adds SMART report line: status, enabled/disabled, health, powered on,
cycles, and some error cases if out of range values. Note that for Pre\-fail items,
it will show the VALUE and THRESHOLD numbers. It will also fall back for unknown
attributes that are or have been failing and print out the Attribute name, value,
threshold, and failing message. This way even for unhandled Attribute names,
you should get a solid report for full failure cases. Other cases may show
if inxi believes that the item may be approaching failure. This is a guess so
make sure to check the drive and smartctl full output to verify before 
taking any further action.

\- Adds, for USB or other external drives, actual model name/serial if
available, and different from enclosure model/serial, and corrects block 
sizes if necessary. Adds in drive temperature for some drives as well, 
and other useful data.

.TP
.B \-a \-E\fR (\fB\-\-bluetooth\fR)
\- Adds (\fBhciconfig\fR only) extra line to \fBReport:\fR, \fBInfo:\fR. 
Includes, if available, ACL MTU, SCO MTU, Link policy, Link mode, 
and Service Classes.

.TP
.B \-a \-G\fR
Triggers a much more complete Screen/Monitor output on the 
\fBDisplay:\fR line of \fB\-G\fR. Note that the 
basic feature requires \fBxdpyinfo\fR, and the advanced per monitor 
feature requires \fBxrandr\fR. 

No support currently exists for \fBWayland\fR since we so far can find 
no documentation or easy methods to extract this information from \fBWayland\fR 
compositors. This unfortunate situation may change in the future, hopefully. 
However, most \fBWayland\fR systems also come with \fBxwayland\fR, 
which should supply the tools necessary for the time being.

Further note that all references to \fBDisplays\fR, \fBScreens\fR, 
and \fBMonitors\fR are referring to the \fBX\fR technical terms, 
not normal consumer usage. 1 \fBDisplay\fR runs 1 or more 
\fBScreens\fR, and a \fBScreen\fR runs 1 or more \fBMonitors\fR.

\- Adds \fBDisplay\fR ID, for the Display running the Screen that runs the Monitors.

\- Adds total number of \fBScreens\fR listed for the current \fBDisplay\fR.

\- Adds default \fBScreen\fR ID if Screen (not monitor!) total is greater than 1.

\- Adds \fBScreen\fR line, which includes the ID (\fBScreen: 0\fR) then \fBs-res\fR 
(Screen resolution), \fBs\-dpi\fR, \fBs\-size\fR and \fBs\-diag\fR. Remember, this is an 
Xorg \fBScreen\fR, NOT a monitor screen, and the information listed is about
the Xorg Screen! It may at times be the same as a single monitor system, 
but usually it's different in some ways.

\- Adds \fBMonitor\fR ID(s). Monitors are a subset of a Screen, each of which
can have one or more monitors. Normally a dual monitor setup is 2 monitors 
run by one Xorg Screen. Each monitor has the following data, if available:

\- \fBres:\fR resolution in pixels. This is the individual monitor's 
reported pixel dimensions.

\- \fBhz:\fR frequency in Herz, as reported to Xorg. Note that there have been
and may continue to be bugs with how Xorg treats > 1 monitor frequencies.

\- \fBdpi:\fR dpi (dots per inch), aka, ppi (pixels per inch). This is the 
physical screen dpi, which is calculated using the screen dimensions and its
resolution. 

\- \fBsize:\fR size in mm (inches). Note that this is the real monitor size,
not the Xorg Screen size, which can be quite different (1 Xorg Screen can 
for instance contain two or more monitors). 

\- \fBdiag:\fR monitor screen diagonal in mm (inches). Note that this is 
the real monitor size, not the Xorg full Screen diagonal size, which 
can be quite different.

\- Adds, if present, possible \fBalternate:\fR kernel modules capable of driving 
each \fBDevice\-x\fR (not including the current \fBloaded:\fR). If no non\-driver 
modules found, shows nothing. NOTE: just because it lists a module does NOT mean it is
available in the system, it's just something the kernel knows could possibly be used 
instead. 

.TP
.B \-a \-I\fR

\- Adds service control tool, tested for in the following order: \fBsystemctl 
rc-service service sv /etc/rc.d /etc/init.d\fR - useful to know which you need 
when using an unfamiliar machine.

.TP
.B \-a \-j\fR, \fB\-a \-P\fR [swap], \fB\-a \-P\fR [swap]
\- Adds swappiness and vfs cache pressure, and a message to indicate 
if the value is the default value or not (Linux only, and only if available). 
If not the default value, shows default value as well, e.g. 

For \fB\-P\fR per swap physical partition:

\fBswappiness: 60 (default) cache\-pressure: 90 (default 100)\fR

For \fB\-j\fR row 1 output:

\fBKernel: swappiness: 60 (default) cache\-pressure: 90 (default 100)\fR

\- Adds device kernel major:minor number (Linux only).

.TP
.B \-a \-L\fR
\- Expands Component report, shows size / maj-min of components and devices, and
mapped name for logical components. Puts each component/device on its own line.

\- Adds maj-min to LV and other devices.

\fBsize: 58.81 GiB (98.01%)\fR.

Note that \fBused: 16.44 GiB (34.3%)\fR percent refers to the available size,

.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-alt 40\fR
Bypass \fBPerl\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny),
Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

.TP
.B \-\-alt 41\fR
Bypass \fBCurl\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny),
Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

.TP
.B \-\-alt 42\fR
Bypass \fBFetch\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny),
Curl, Wget, Fetch, (OpenBSD only) ftp.

.TP
.B \-\-alt 43\fR
Bypass \fBWget\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Perl (HTTP::Tiny),
Curl, Wget, Fetch, OpenBSD only: ftp

.TP
.B \-\-alt 44\fR
Bypass \fBCurl\fR, \fBFetch\fR, and \fBWget\fR as downloader options. This
basically forces the downloader selection to use \fBPerl 5.x\fR \fBHTTP::Tiny\fR,
which is generally slower than \fBCurl\fR or \fBWget\fR but it may help bypass
issues with downloading.

.TP
.B \-\-bt\-tool [bt\-adapter|hciconfig]\fR
Force the use of the given tool for bluetooth report (\fB\-E\fR). 

.TP
.B \-\-dig\fR
Temporary override of \fBNO_DIG\fR configuration item. Only use to test w/wo dig.
Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use dig if present.

.TP
.B \-\-display [:<integer>]\fR
Will try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as root user).
Default gets display info from display \fB:0\fR. If you use the format
\fB\-\-display :1\fR then it would get it from display \fB1\fR instead,
or any display you specify.

Note that in some cases, \fB\-\-display\fR will cause inxi to hang endlessly when
running the option in console with Intel graphics. The situation regarding
other free drivers such as nouveau/ATI is currently unknown. It may be that
this is a bug with the Intel graphics driver \- more information is required.

You can test this easily by running the following command out of X/display server:
\fBglxinfo \-display :0\fR

If it hangs, \fB\-\-display\fR will not work.

.TP
.B \-\-dmidecode\fR
Shortcut, legacy. See \fB\-\-force dmidecode\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-downloader [curl|fetch|perl|wget]\fR
Force inxi to use Curl, Fetch, Perl, or Wget for downloads.

.TP
.B \-\-force [dmidecode|hddtemp|lsusb|usb-sys|vmstat|wmctl]\fR 
Various force options to allow users to override defaults. Values be given
as a comma separated list:

\fBinxi \-MJ --force dmidecode,lsusb\fR 

\- \fBdmidecode\fR \- Force use of \fBdmidecode\fR. This will override \fB/sys\fR 
data in some lines, e.g. \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-B\fR.

\- \fBhddtemp\fR \- Force use of hddtemp instead of /sys temp data for disks.

\- \fBlsusb\fR \- Forces the USB data generator to use \fBlsusb\fR as 
data source (default). Overrides \fBUSB_SYS\fR in user configuration file(s).

\- \fBusb-sys\fR \- Forces the USB data generator to use \fB/sys\fR as 
data source instead of \fBlsusb\fR (Linux only).

\- \fBvmstat\fR \- Forces use of vmstat for memory data.

\- \fBwmctl\fR \- Force \fBSystem\fR item \fBwm\fR to use \fBwmctrl\fR 
as data source, override default \fBps\fR source.

.TP
.B \-\-hddtemp\fR
Shortcut, legacy. See \fB\-\-force hddtemp\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-host\fR
Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set):

\fBSHOW_HOST='false'\fR \- Same as: \fBSHOW_HOST='true'\fR

This is an absolute override, the host will always show no matter what
other switches you use.

.TP
.B \-\-html\-wan\fR
Temporary override of \fBNO_HTML_WAN\fR configuration item. Only use to test w/wo 
HTML downloaders for WAN IP. Restores default behavior for WAN IP, which is use HTML 
downloader if present and if dig failed.

.TP
.B \-\-limit [\-1 \- x]\fR
Raise or lower max output limit of IP addresses for \fB\-i\fR. \fB\-1\fR removes limit.

.TP
.B \-\-man\fR
Updates / installs man page with \fB\-U\fR if \fBpinxi\fR or using \fB\-U 3\fR dev branch.
(Only active if \fB\-U\fR is is not disabled by maintainers).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-dig\fR
Overrides default use of \fBdig\fR to get WAN IP address. Allows use of normal 
downloader tool to get IP addresses. Only use if dig is failing, since dig is much
faster and more reliable in general than other methods.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-doas\fR
Skips the use of doas to run certain internal features (like \fBhddtemp\fR, \fBfile\fR) 
with doas. Not related to running inxi itself with doas/sudo or super user. 
Some systems will register errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so if 
you want to disable regular user use of doas (which requires configuration to setup 
anyway for these options) just use this option, or \fBNO_DOAS\fR configuration item.
See \fB\-\-no\-sudo\fR if you need to disable both types.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-host\fR
Turns off hostname in System line. This is default when using \fB\-z\fR,
for anonymizing inxi output for posting on forums or IRC. Overrides
configuration value (if set):
indent\-min
\fBSHOW_HOST='true'\fR \- Same as: \fBSHOW_HOST='false'\fR

This is an absolute override, the host will not show no matter what other 
switches you use.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-html-wan\fR
Overrides use of HTML downloaders to get WAN IP address. Use either only dig, or 
do not get wan IP. Only use if dig is failing, and the HTML downloaders are taking
too long, or are hanging or failing. 
Make permanent with \fBNO_HTML_WAN='true'\fR

.TP
.B \-\-no\-man\fR
Disables man page install with \fB\-U\fR for master and active development branches.
(Only active if \fB\-U\fR is is not disabled by maintainers).

.TP
.B \-\-no\-sensor\-force\fR
Overrides user set \fBSENSOR_FORCE\fR configuration value. Restores default behavior. 

.TP
.B \-\-no\-ssl\fR
Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions (\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-w\fR,
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-i\fR). Use if your system does not have current SSL certificate
lists, or if you have problems making a connection for any reason. Works with
\fBWget\fR, \fBCurl\fR, \fBPerl HTTP::Tiny\fR and \fBFetch\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-sudo\fR
Skips the use of sudo to run certain internal features (like \fBhddtemp\fR, \fBfile\fR) 
with sudo. Not related to running inxi itself with sudo or super user. 
Some systems will register errors which will then trigger admin emails in such cases, so if 
you want to disable regular user use of sudo (which requires configuration to setup 
anyway for these options) just use this option, or \fBNO_SUDO\fR configuration item.

.TP
.B \-\-output [json|screen|xml]\fR
Change data output type. Requires \-\-output\-file if not \fBscreen\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-output\-file [full path to output file|print]\fR
The given directory path must exist. The directory path given must exist,
The \fBprint\fR options prints to stdout.
Required for non\-screen \fB\-\-output\fR formats (json|xml).

.TP
.B \-\-partition\-sort [dev\-base|fs|id|label|percent\-used|size|uuid|used]\fR
Change default sort order of partition output. Corresponds to \fBPARTITION_SORT\fR
configuration item. These are the available sort options:

\fBdev\-base\fR - \fB/dev\fR partition identifier, like \fB/dev/sda1\fR. 
Note that it's an alphabetic sort, so \fBsda12\fR is before \fBsda2\fR.

\fBfs\fR \- Partition filesystem. Note that sorts will be somewhat random if all 
filesystems are the same.

\fBid\fR \- Mount point of partition (default).

\fBlabel\fR \- Label of partition. If partitions have no labels, 
sort will be random.

\fBpercent\-used\fR - Percentage of partition size used.

\fBsize\fR \- KiB size of partition.

\fBuuid\fR \- UUID of the partition.

\fBused\fR \- KiB used of partition.

.TP
.B \-\-pm\-type [package manager name]\fR
For distro package maintainers only, and only for non apt, rpm, or pacman based systems. 
To be used to test replacement package lists for recommends for that package manager.

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-default\fR
Overrides configuration values \fBSENSORS_USE\fR or \fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR
on a one time basis. 

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-exclude\fR
Similar to \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR except removes listed sensors from sensor data.
Make permanent with \fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR configuration item. Note that gpu, network,
disk, and other specific device monitor chips are excluded by default.

Example: \fBinxi \-sxx \-\-sensors\-exclude k10temp-pci-00c3\fR

.TP
.B \-\-sensors\-use\fR
Use only the  (comma separated) sensor arrays for \fB\-s\fR output. Make permanent 
with \fBSENSORS_USE\fR configuration item. Sensor array ID value must be the exact 
value shown in lm\-sensors sensors output (Linux/lm-sensors only). If you only want
to exclude one (or more) sensors from the output, use \fB\-\-sensors\-exlude\fR.

Can be useful if the default sensor data used by inxi is not from the right sensor 
array. Note that all other sensor data will be removed, which may lead to undesired
consequences. Please be aware that this can lead to many undesirable side\-effects,
since default behavior is to use all the sensors arrays and select which values
to use from them following a set sequence of rules. So if you force one to be used,
you may lose data that was used from another one.

Most likely best use is when one (or two) of the sensor arrays has all the sensor data 
you want, and you just want to make sure inxi doesn't use data from another array that
has inacurate or misleading data.

Note that gpu, network, disk, and other specific device monitor chips are excluded by 
default, and should not be added since they do not provide cpu, board, system, etc,
sensor data.

Example: \fBinxi \-sxx \-\-sensors\-use nct6791-isa-0290,k10temp-pci-00c3\fR

.TP
.B \-\-sleep [0\-x.x]\fR
Usually in decimals. Change CPU sleep time for \fB\-C\fR (current: \fB\0.35\fR).
Sleep is used to let the system catch up and show a more accurate CPU use. Example:

\fBinxi \-Cxxx \-\-sleep 0.15\fR

Overrides default internal value and user configuration value:

\fBCPU_SLEEP=0.25\fR

.TP
.B \-\-tty\fR
Forces internal IRC flag to off. Used in unhandled cases where the program running
inxi may not be seen as a shell/tty, but it is not an IRC client. Put \fB\-\-tty\fR 
first in option list to avoid unexpected errors. If you want a specific 
output width, use the \fB\-\-width\fR option. If you want normal color codes in
the output, use the  \fB\-c [color ID]\fR flag.

The sign you need to use this is extra numbers before the key/value pairs of the 
output of your program. These are IRC, not TTY, color codes. Please post a github 
issue if you find you need to use \fB\-\-tty\fR (including the full 
\fB\-Ixxx\fR line) so we can figure out how to add your program to the list 
of whitelisted programs.

You can see what inxi believed started it in the \fB\-Ixxx\fR line, \fBShell:\fR or 
\fBClient:\fR item. Please let us know what that result was so we can add it to the 
parent start program whitelist.

.TP
.B \-\-usb\-sys\fR
Shortcut, legacy. See \fB\-\-force usb\-sys\fR

.TP
.B \-\-usb\-tool\fR
Shortcut, legacy. See \fB\-\-force lsusb\fR

.TP
.B \-\-wan\-ip\-url [URL]\fR
Force \fB\-i\fR to use supplied URL as WAN IP source. Overrides dig or 
default IP source urls. URL must start with http[s] or ftp.

The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non\-empty) line 
of the page content source code.

Same as configuration value (example):

\fBWAN_IP_URL='https://mysite.com/ip.php'\fR

.TP
.B \-\-wm\fR
Shortcut, legacy. See \fB\-\-force wmctl\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-wrap\-max [integer]\fR
Overrides default or configuration set line starter wrap width value. 
Wrap max is the maximum width that inxi will wrap line starters (e.g. \fBInfo:\fR) 
to their own lines, with data lines indented only 2 columns. If terminal/console 
width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than wrap width, wrapping of line starter occurs.
If \fB80\fR or less, no wrapping will occur. 
Overrides internal default value (90) and user configuration value:

\fBWRAP_MAX=85\fR (previously \fBINDENT_MIN\fR)

Previously called: \fB\-\-indent\-min\fR.

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS

.TP
.B \-\-dbg 1\fR

.TP
.B \-\-debug [1\-3]\fR
\- On screen debugger output. Output varies depending on current needs
Usually nothing changes.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 10\fR
\- Basic logging. Check \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME/inxi/inxi.log\fR or
\fB$HOME/.local/share/inxi/inxi.log\fR or \fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.log\fR.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 11\fR
\- Full file/system info logging.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 20\fR
Creates a tar.gz file of system data and collects the inxi output
in a file.

* tree traversal data file(s) read from \fB/proc\fR and \fB/sys\fR, and 
other system data.

* xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.

* data from dev, disks, partitions, etc.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 21\fR
Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.smxi.org\fR,
then removes the debug data directory, but leaves the debug tar.gz file.
See \fB\-\-ftp\fR for uploading to alternate locations.

.TP
.B \-\-debug 22\fR
Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.smxi.org\fR, then
removes the debug data directory and the tar.gz file.
See \fB\-\-ftp\fR for uploading to alternate locations.

.TP
.B \-\-ftp [ftp.yoursite.com/incoming]\fR
For alternate ftp upload locations: Example:

\fBinxi \-\-ftp \fIftp.yourserver.com/incoming\fB \-\-debug 21\fR

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS TO DEBUG DEBUGGER FAILURES

Only use the following in conjunction with \fB\-\-debug 2[012]\fR, and only 
use if you experienced a failure or hang, or were instructed to do so.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-proc\fR
Force debugger to parse \fB/proc\fR directory data when run as root. Normally this is
disabled due to unpredictable data in /proc tree. 

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-proc\-print\fR
Use this to locate file that /proc debugger hangs on.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-exit\fR
Skip exit on error when running debugger.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-proc\fR
Skip /proc debugging in case of a hang.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-no\-sys\fR
Skip /sys debugging in case of a hang.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-sys\fR
Force PowerPC debugger parsing of /sys as doas[BSDs]/sudo/root.

.TP
.B \-\-debug\-sys\-print\fR
Use this to locate file that /sys debugger hangs on.

.SH SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS
BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, Weechat,
and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying either built\-in or external
script output.

.SH RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the
list below:
.TP
.B Hexchat, XChat, Irssi
\fR(and many other IRC clients)
.B /exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]
If you don't include the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local
IRC client.
.TP
.B Konversation
.B /cmd inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

To run inxi in Konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi package
hasn't already done this for you, create this symbolic link:

KDE 4:
.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

KDE 5:
.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi

If inxi is somewhere else, change the path \fB/usr/local/bin\fR to wherever it
is located.

If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also need to add the following to get
the Konversation \fR/inxi\fR command to work:

.B ln \-s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/

Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

.B /inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
.TP
.B WeeChat
.B NEW: /exec \-o inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

.B OLD: /shell \-o inxi
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console
IRC clients, with \fB/exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]. Newer WeeChats
have dropped the \fB\-curses\fR part of their program name, i.e.:
\fBweechat\fR instead of \fBweechat\-curses\fR.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
inxi will read its configuration/initialization files in the
following order:

\fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR contains the default configurations. These can be overridden
by user configurations found in one of the following locations (inxi will
store its config file using the following precedence:
if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not empty, it will go there, else if
\fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR exists, it will go there, and as a last default,
the legacy location is used), i.e.:

\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf\fR > \fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR >
\fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf\fR

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

See the documentation page for more complete information on how to set
these up, and for a complete list of options:

.I https://smxi.org/docs/inxi\-configuration.htm
.TP
.B Basic Options
Here's a brief overview of the basic options you are likely to want to use:

\fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR The max display column width on terminal.
If terminal/console width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than wrap width, 
wrapping of line starter occurs
\fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR The max display column width on IRC clients.

\fBCOLS_MAX_NO_DISPLAY\fR The max display column width in console, out of GUI desktop.

\fBCPU_SLEEP\fR Decimal value \fB0\fR or more. Default is usually around \fB0.35\fR
seconds. Time that inxi will 'sleep' before getting CPU speed data, so that it
reflects actual system state.

\fBDOWNLOADER\fR Sets default inxi downloader: curl, fetch, ftp, perl, wget.
See \fB\-\-recommends\fR output for more information on downloaders and Perl downloaders.

\fBFILTER_STRING\fR Default \fB<filter>\fR. Any string you prefer to see instead
for filtered values.

\fBLIMIT\fR Overrides default of \fB10\fR IP addresses per IF. This is only of interest
to sys admins running servers with many IP addresses.

\fBNO_DIG\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable WAN IP use of \fBdig\fR and force
use of alternate downloaders.

\fBNO_DOAS\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable internal use of \fBdoas\fR.

\fBNO_HTML_WAN\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable WAN IP use of \fBHTML Downloaders\fR and force
use of dig only, or nothing if dig disabled as well. Same as \fB\-\-no\-html\-wan\fR. Only use if 
dig is failing, and HTML downloaders are hanging.

\fBNO_SUDO\fR Set to \fB1\fR or \fBtrue\fR to disable internal use of \fBsudo\fR.

\fBPARTITION_SORT\fR Overrides default partition output sort. See 
\fB\-\-partition\-sort\fR for options.

\fBPS_COUNT\fR The default number of items showing per \fB\-t\fR type, \fBm\fR or 
\fBc\fR. Default is 5.

\fBSENSORS_CPU_NO\fR In cases of ambiguous temp1/temp2 (inxi can't figure out which
is the CPU), forces sensors to use  either value 1 or 2 as CPU temperature. See the
above configuration page on smxi.org for full info.

\fBSENSORS_EXCLUDE\fR Exclude supplied sensor array[s] from sensor output. Override with 
\fB\-\-sensors\-default\fR. See \fB\-\-sensors\-exclude\fR.

\fBSENSORS_USE\fR Use only supplied sensor array[s]. Override with 
\fB\-\-sensors\-default\fR. See \fB\-\-sensors\-use\fR.

\fBSEP2_CONSOLE\fR Replaces default key / value separator of '\fB:\fR'.

\fBUSB_SYS\fR Forces all USB data to use \fB/sys\fR instead of \fBlsusb\fR.

\fBWAN_IP_URL\fR Forces \fB\-i\fR to use supplied URL, and to not use dig (dig is
generally much faster). URL must begin with http or ftp. Note that if you use this,
the downloader set tests will run each time you start inxi whether a downloader feature
is going to be used or not. 

The IP address from the URL must be the last item on the last (non\-empty) line of 
the URL's page content source code.

Same as \fB\-\-wan\-ip\-url [URL]\fR

\fBWEATHER_SOURCE\fR Values: [\fB0-9\fR]. Same as \fB\-\-weather\-source\fR. Values
4\-9 are not currently supported, but this can change at any time.

\fBWEATHER_UNIT\fR Values: [\fBm\fR|\fBi\fR|\fBmi\fR|\fBim\fR]. Same as \fB\-\-weather\-unit\fR.

\fBWRAP_MAX\fR (previously \fBINDENT_MIN\fR) The maximum width where the line starter wraps 
to its own line. If terminal/console width or \fB\-\-width\fR is less than wrap width, 
wrapping of line starter occurs. Overrides default. See \fB\-\-wrap\-max\fR. 
If \fB80\fR or less, wrap will never happen.

.TP
.B Color Options
It's best to use the \fB\-c [94\-99]\fR color selector tool to set the following values
because it will correctly update the configuration file and remove any invalid
or conflicting items, but if you prefer to create your own configuration files,
here are the options. All take the integer value from the options available in
\fB\-c 94\-99\fR.

NOTE: All default and configuration file set color values are removed when output is 
piped or redirected. You must use the explicit \fB\-c <color number>\fR option 
if you want colors to be present in the piped/redirected output (creating a PDF for
example).

\fBCONSOLE_COLOR_SCHEME\fR The color scheme for console output (not in X/Wayland).

\fBGLOBAL_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Overrides all other color schemes.

\fBIRC_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Desktop X/Wayland IRC CLI color scheme.

\fBIRC_CONS_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Out of X/Wayland, IRC CLI color scheme.

\fBIRC_X_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME\fR In X/Wayland IRC client terminal color scheme.

\fBVIRT_TERM_COLOR_SCHEME\fR Color scheme for virtual terminal output (in X/Wayland).

.SH BUGS
Please report bugs using the following resources.

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool (see \fB\-\-debug 21/22\fR), which will 
upload a data dump of system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are 
very important since they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse 
out its report.

.SH  AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE

.B inxi
is a fork of \fBlocsmif\fR's very clever \fBinfobash\fR script.

Original infobash author and copyright holder:
Copyright (C) 2005\-2007  Michiel de Boer aka locsmif

inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008\-2021 Harald Hope

This man page was originally created by Gordon Spencer (aka aus9) and is
maintained by Harald Hope (aka h2 or TechAdmin).

Initial CPU logic, konversation version logic, occasional maintenance fixes,
and the initial xiin.py tool for /sys parsing (obsolete, but still very much
appreciated for all the valuable debugger data it helped generate): Scott Rogers

Further fixes (listed as known):

Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) \- USB audio patch; swap percent used patch.

Jarett.Stevens \- \fBdmidecode \-M\fR patch for older systems with no \fB/sys\fR.

.SH SPECIAL THANKS TO THE FOLLOWING

The nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux\-smokers\-club and #smxi,
who  all really have to be considered to be co\-developers because of their
non\-stop enthusiasm and willingness to provide real\-time testing and debugging
of inxi development.

Siduction forum members, who have helped get some features working by providing
a large number of datasets that have revealed possible variations, particularly for the
RAM \fB\-m\fR option.

AntiX users and admins, who have helped greatly with testing and debugging,
particularly for the 3.0.0 release.

ArcherSeven (Max), Brett Bohnenkamper (aka KittyKatt), and Iotaka, who always 
manage to find the weirdest or most extreme hardware and setups that help make 
inxi much more robust.

For the vastly underrated skill of output error/glitch catching, Pete Haddow. His
patience and focus in going through inxi repeatedly to find errors and inconsistencies 
is much appreciated.

All the inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum moderators,
and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, which almost always
help make inxi better, and any others who contribute ideas, suggestions, and patches.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel\-based Free Desktop systems to test
on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning
out to be.

And of course, a big thanks to locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods,
logic, and tricks originally used in inxi Gawk/Bash.
