.SH NAME
inxi  - Command line system information script for console and IRC 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B inxi \fR - Single line, short form. Very basic output.

.B inxi \fR[\fB--help\fR] \fR[\fB--recommends\fR] \fR[\fB--version\fR] \fR[\fB-@ NUMBER\fR] 

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B inxi
.R is a command line system information script built for for console and IRC. It is also used for forum technical
support, as a debugging tool, to quickly ascertain user system configuration and hardware. inxi shows system 
hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of other 
useful information. 

.B inxi
.R output varies between CLI and IRC, with some default filters and color options applied to IRC use. Script colors can
be turned off if desired with -c 0, or changed using the -c color options listed in the OPTIONS section below.

.SH RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the list below:

.TP
.B Xchat, irssi \fR(and many other IRC clients)
.B /exec -o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]

If you leave off the -o, only you will see the output on your local IRC client.
.TP
.B Konversation
.B /cmd inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]

To run inxi in konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi package did not do this for you, 
create this symbolic link: 

.B ln -s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

If inxi is somewhere else, change the path /usr/local/bin to wherever it is located.

Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

.B /inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]
.TP
.B weechat
.B /shell -o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]

For Weechat to run external scripts like inxi, you have to install shell.py (if you don't already have it). 
To install shell.py, run this command inside of weechat: 

.B /weeget install shell.py

Then to run inxi, you would enter a comand like this: 

.B /shell -o inxi -bx

If you leave off the -o, only you will see the output on your local weechat.

.SH PRIVACY AND SECURITY

In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi filters out automatically on IRC things like
your network card mac address, WAN and LAN IP, your /home username directory in partitions, 
and a few other things.

Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this filtering with the -z
option (-Fz, for example). To override the IRC filter, you can use the -Z option. This can be useful 
to debug network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.

.SH USING OPTIONS

Options can be combined if they do not conflict. Either group the letters 
together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion unless using \fB -t

eg  
.I inxi -AG \fRor\fI inxi -A -G \fRor\fI inxi -c10

.SH EXTRA DATA OPTIONS

These options are for long form only, and can be triggered by one or more -x, like -xx.
Alternately, the -v options trigger them in the following way:
-v 3 adds -x; -v 6 adds -xx; -v 7 adds -xxx

These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in-depth data on various options.
Can be added to any long form option list, like: -bxx or -Sxxx

.SH INITIALIZATION FILE
.TP 
inxi will read the following configuration/initialization files in the following order: 
.TP

.TP
.B $HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf

.SH BUGS 
Please report bugs using the following resources. 

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool which will upload a data dump of all 
system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since 
they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

.SH  AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE

.B inxi
.R is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet very clever, infobash script. 

Original infobash author and copyright holder:
Copyright (C) 2005-2007  Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif

inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008-12 Scott Rogers & Harald Hope

Further fixes (listed as known): Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) - usb audio patch; swap percent used patch

And a special thanks to the nice people at irc.oftc.net channels #linux-smokers-club and #smxi,
who  all really have to be considered to be co-developers because of their non-stop enthusiasm 
and willingness to provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test on, we could 
never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning out to be.

And of course, big thanks locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, logic, 
and tricks used in inxi.

Further thanks to the various inxi package maintainers, distro support people, forum
moderators, and others, who contribute ideas, suggestions, and patches.

This Man page was created by aus9, with help from Harald (aka h2).
