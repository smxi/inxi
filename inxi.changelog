Changes: updated inxi updaters to use github locations.

I will do this commit once for googlecode, and once for github, after that, 
all commits will go only to github.

inxi moves to github, despite my dislike of for profit source repos, and git,
I decided that I just don't have the time or energy to do it right, so I'm going
to use github.

The project is already moved, though I have left inxi up for the time being on 
code.google.com/p/inxi until I move the wiki to http://smxi.org

Everything is pretty much the same, the project url is:

https://github.com/smxi/inxi

The direct download link for the gz is: 

https://github.com/smxi/inxi/raw/master/inxi.tar.gz

git pull is:

git pull https://github.com/smxi/inxi master

svn checkout url:

https://github.com/smxi/inxi

And that's about it.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes a bug with the last fix for KDE Plasma version. It was
showing Frameworks version, which is apparently NOT the same as the plasma version.

Also added debugger kde versioning to make this stuff less of an ordeal for data collection.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Got a good fix for the kde version issue from the lads at
#kde-devel, now using kf5-config --version  which gives similar output to kded4 --version

I use this for both 4 and 5, but since 4 has worked fine for years, I'll just use this for 5
and later.

Version: 2.2.24
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2015-06-15
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, new tarball. Adapted to deal with yet another silly pointless change from
normal, in this case, sddm decided that using a .pid or .lock file in /run was too easy
so they changed to some session id type string in the /run/sddm/ directory.

Speaking for myself, I find such pointless changes from anything resembling normal behaviors
to the reason that gnu freedesktop systems will never achieve significant desktop use globally.

Also, in the same vein, added debuggers to try to figure out what plasma5/kde 5 is using
internally to give command line version information. Again, something pointless internally
was changed, thus breaking something that had faintly resembled an api, which is of course
why desktop gnu linux will never actually take off, developers in the real world have no
interest in chasing after such pointless and never ending churn in even the most trivial 
areas of the OS, let alone the core.

inxi remains however as a log of this ongoing churn and lack of discipline, and so remains
an interesting process of observation, and a way for users to try to avoid the constant
changes in simple system queries that should really never change, so I can see a reason
to keep it going since it's obvious that the actual foss ecosystem itself will not and apparently
cannot grasp that it is the lack of stable apis, methods, etc, that has kept desktop gnu linux
from achieving any actual real world success or popularity, and that is the actual problem
that should be fixed, not some pointless internal change to something.

On the source repo front, maintainers, I still can't find an acceptable alternative to the
impending shutdown of googlecode. github is a for profit venture that people who seem totally
void of any sense of history believe is actually going to be around longer than say, sourceforge,
or googlecode, as a legitimate source hosting site.

I'd welcome any suggestions. So far all the options are bad that I can find.

Top preference is svn, but if git is the absolute only other choice for an otherwise good option,
I'd consider git, but it's a horrible option for inxi because of how inxi development and debugging
works, vs how git works. ie, svn branches are perfect, git branches are totally wrong.

I may end up just hosting the svn on my own servers to avoid having to move yet again when the next
for profit flakey site decides to close up or monetize the source hosting.

The original idea of googlecode was for google to 'pay its dues to the foss community', but apparently
they got bored with that idea, plus of course, the ongoing total failure of google to deal with 
automated spam, which has always been a huge bug in the core google corporate culture. But googlecode
was by far the best option I've come across, it was done by a deep pocketed corporation not for profit
for pretty good reasons, and was never intended to be a profit center, which is the closest I could
see for a non free option. 

Setting up svn gui stuff however is a royal pain and requires ongoing maintainance for the life of
the software, which is NOT fun, nor will I sign up for that obligation.

I may end up moving to github anyway, even though git truly sucks for inxi and myself, but it's an 
idea I find fairly vile, apparently free software (sic) authors seem to have no grasp of the concept
of fredom when it comes to source code hosting, judging by the absurd popularity of github as the
default go to source repo. Their website is pathetic as well, which isn't very promising.

So we'll see where it goes, I think I have until august to decide what to do for source hosting.

Since I'm old enough to have seen sourceforge and now googlecode do the same thing, along with a lot
of other options, to say github won't do this too is delusional, what you can almost certainly say is it 
will do it, the only question is when. But, just as Linus did with his non free linux kernel version
control, people will stick with the non free stuff until you realize you can't use it anymore, because 
it is non free. Free software hosted on non free source repos is to me one of the most absurd and
stupid things I've ever heard of to be honest.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Tiny change. Added /etc/devuan_version file to distro id to handle
the switched file name. Kudos to anyone out there fighting to create a working alternative
to the unreliable and buggy and windows emulating systemd, I wish devuan luck. Maybe between
devuan and gentoo and slackware we can save the free software core systems before it's too late.

Version: 2.2.22
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2015-05-30
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Modified slightly -tc and -tm output to fix a 
pet peeve of mine. Now, if -I, -b, -F, or anything that can trigger the memory: used/total
in Information line is not used, -tm will always show the system used/total ram data on the 
first line of the Memory item of -t output.

Also, if -xtc (trigger ram data in cpu output) is used, and -I is not triggered, and -tm is
not triggered, will also show system used/total ram data on the cpu first line.

I'd found it odd that this data did not appear when -tcm or -tm or -xtc were used, so this is
now fixed. I used the -t option a fair amount to find memory/cpu use issues, and usually I
don't use the option with other options, so the lack of total system ram data was odd.

New version, new tarball. A desktop id fix, Mate id failed, mate moved to a more

-----------------------------------
New version, updated man page, new tarball. Updated -r to for portage gentoo sources. This should work
fine for all derived distros like Sabayon as well. The test looks for:
/etc/portage/repos.conf/ and type -p emerge
if found will then grab the repos from the source files found.

Note that the logic for this was almost identical to that used for rpm so it was an
easy addon. Please let us know if you have an issue and provide data samples of relevant
files.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Two great bug report, issues. 

1. Tightened runit init detection to use proc, note that if runit works on BSDs inxi will
   require more data to properly detect it on BSDs..
2. Use openrc runlevel tests natively if openrc detected.
3. Fixed subtle issue with alias to inxi file and paths.
4. Added rc-status data collection for debugger, improved debugger data collector handling
   of bsd and other tests to note absent if not there in file names.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New Version, new tarball.

Fixed bugs in Epoch init system detection, caused false positives in systems booted on
SysVinit, but with Epoch installed. Epoch turns out to be in PID 1 == epoch (/proc/1/comm)
so that's easy to fix.

Also fixed spacing isxue with OpenRC output in -I line.

Version: 2.2.16
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-11-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Very small update, added sddm id to dm detecfion. Because Arch linux, 
at least on the system I got data from, is not using .pid/.lock extensions, but other systems
are, I'm adding sddm AND sddm.pid detection. This required changing the id to use explicit -f
for test, not the previous -e, which will force only files, not directories, to trigger yes case.

No other changes, but it's worth updating to this because distros may start using sddm in the not so
distant future, it's beta currently though.

Script Date:  2014-10-12
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Debian has for some reason broken procps / uptime support, for
as of yet unknown reasons, so rather than wait to see the bug resolved, I'm just removing
uptime as a depenendency, though this is a short term hack only because we don't know
why it was removed from procps or if that was just a mistake, or if other things as well might
be vanishing from procps. Am leaving in however uname as dependency because inxi cannot
determine what platform it is when it starts without that.

New version, new tarball. This fixes broken slackpkg handling in -r, and, using the same fix,
fixes a single scenario with apt, where there is only sources.list, no .d/*.list files. 
I was assuming that the file name would print out in the output of single file grep, 
but that only happens with multiple files.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Mostly bsd fixes, a few for linux disk info.

Added support, basic, for bsd hard disks, and optical disks.

Added hard disk total/percent used for BSDs, sort of.

These are mostly just hacks since the data isn't easily available from system
standard tools, though I could on freebsd use gpart I guess but that's another tool
needed, and another method, too much work imo for small results.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Cleaned up and made more consistent the cpu max/min output.

Now the short form, the -b/-v1 form, and the -C forms are all similar.

Also, added a few hacks to try to extract cpu max speed from cpu model string in
either sysctl -a OR /var/run/dmesg.boot data in freebsd/openbsd. Sometimes it may
work if that data was in the model string. It's a hack, but will do until we get
better data sources or they update their sources to list more data.

Version: 2.2.5
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-09-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes a long standing weakness with min/max cpu speed
handling. Or rather, non handling, since that data only showed in rare cases on short form
(inxi no args) output. Now it uses /sys query to determine min/max speed of cpu, and uses
that data to override any other min/max data discovered.

Still uses /proc/cpuinfo for actual speeds per core. The assumption in this is that all
cares will have the same min/max speeds, which is generally going to be a safe assumption.

Now in short form, inxi, output, it will show actual speed then (max speed) or just (max)
if actual speed matches max speed. Same for -b short CPU output.

For long, -C output, shows max speed before the actual cpu core speeds per core. 

With -xx, and in multi cpu/core systems only, shows if available min/max speeds.

Note that not all /sys have this data, so it doesn't show any N/A if it's missing.

New version, new tarball. Mostly bsd changes, except for downloader options, which now
permit wget/curl/(openbsd ftp)/(bsd fetch) interchangeably.

This lets more standard downloader defaults in bsds, as well as curl on gnu/linux systems
without triggering an error of missing wget.

1. Fixed cpu core issues on bsds, now shows core count + if > 1, cpus total.

2. Now shows OS instead of Distro on short/long output, since each bsd is an OS.

3. fixed vmstat issues for used memory outputs

Also fixed potential failures with cpu core count array by making it a ',' separated array.

New version, new tarball. Contains a major bug fix for a regression introduced in 2.2.2

-m/-M would always show requires root for dmidecode no matter what. Also improved dmidecode
error messages/handling.

Also, a fix for no display card data, now shows as expected no card data

Most other fixes are for bsd, mostly openbsd.

1. Added a class for network devices in freebsd pciconf

2. Added -r support for openbsd

3. Fixed some cpu issues for openbsd

4. Fixed an issue in openbsd/freebsd where client version data failed to get cleaned

5. Changed inxi short form output for bsds to show OS data instead of kernel data.

6. BSDs, maybe all, different syntax in xorg.0.log made unloaded gfx drivers not show, 
   that is fixed now.
   
-p fixed file system type in -p/-P for openbsd, now shows.

-I / inxi short - fixed used memory, did not show in openbsd, now does.

-f fixed cpu flags in openbsd, now works

-C corrected corrupted cpu data outputs, in openbsd at least, maybe also freebsd

-C added an openbsd hack to sometimes show cpu L2 cache

-m/-M fixed/improved dmidecode error handling for all systems

modified handling of dmesg.boot data, synched so gawk can parse better.

Version: 2.2.00
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-08-18
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. Maintainers, this is the official release of -m feature.

I have collected enough datasamples to allow for reasonably fine grained corrections, estimates,
warnings about unreliable capacity now, and have fixed all major failures. 

Also, because this stuff is filled out by people somewhere, or not, some fields often are just
empty, or contain the default values, ie, they are worthless. inxi shows N/A for those situations,
it means there is really no actual data to show you.

This feature, sadly, well never be totally reliable, because dmi data is frankly junk, especially
dmi type 5 and 16, which is what is supposed to tell you total capacity of memory array, and the
maximum module size (type 5). However, this data is totally random, often it is right, sometimes
it is wrong. Sometimes type 5 is right and type 16 is wrong, sometimes the other way. And since
type 5 is only present in some systems, it's not reliable anyway.

What is reliable and always right is the actually installed memory per device, ie, sticks. I have
not seen any errors in that, so that seems to be actually coming from the system itself. type 5 / 16
sadly are clearly entered in manually by some poorly paid engineers out there in the world, and are
often total fictions, either far too small, or far too big, or whatever.

inxi will attempt to correct all clear logic errors, and whenever it changes the listed data from 
type 5/16, it notes either (est) or (check). (est) means it is a good guess, one I am comfortable making,
(check) means it is either an unreliable guess, or that what the system is reporting is so unlikely that
even though inxi is showing it, it doubts it could actually be true, or at least, it thinks you
should check this yourself. 

-m has 3 extra data options, -x prints the part number, if found, and the max module size, if type 5
is present. inxi does NOT attempt to guess at max module size based on what is installed, it only will
correct a listed max module size if installed modules are > than listed max size. Usually part numbers,
if present, are all you need to order a new stick.

-xx shows serial number, manufacturer (often empty, or just random alphanumeric identifiers, but sometimes
they list the actual company name, which is helpful. It also shows, if type 5 data is present, single/double
bank.

-xxx as usual shows largely useless data that may be of interest to soemone, like if ram type is synchronous, 
memory bus width data, and module voltage (type 5 data).

This feature will never be reliable I am sad to say because the source data itself is random and much
has been filled out, or not filled out, by engineering drones somewhere out there in the underpaid
world. The ranges of errors are so wide that inxi just has to check what is possible, reasonable, unlikely,
etc, to generate its numbers. In other words, this is NOT just parsing dmidecode output, that is the raw
material only, sad to say.

So this is it, for better or worse. All bug / issue reports with this MUST come with a full:
inxi -xx@14 
hardware data upload, run as root. 

Also, much to my annoyance, this feature requires root, since /dev/mem needs root to be read, and I assume
the dmi table, so that is a departure from normal inxi standards, as is the low quality input, and thus,
output, data, though I can guarantee that what inxi tells you is in most cases on average more accurate than
what dmidecode tells you, since dmidecode simply prints out what it finds in the dmi table, and nothing else,
in whatever order it finds it, from what I can see, ie, you also cannot trust the order of dmidecode output.

I had been hoping that /sys would start to contain memory data like it does mobo/system data, but it never
happened so I finally decided to just do the ram thing, require dmidecode, require root/sudo, and that's
that.

There will be issue reports, you can help them by looking up the mobo stats/specs yourself and listing them
in the issue, so I don't have to do it. I use the tool at crucial.com which is very accurate and also very 
complete in terms of all possible hardware out there. 

I would trust that tool before trusting the companies that have the least reliable data, like ASUS.

Much thanks to everyone who is contributing datasets, and the distros, particularly siduction, that really 
were very helpful in this process, by finding more and more failure cases that helped me start to tighten
the logic, and make it more and more robust. Special thanks to Mikaela, of #smxi irc.oftc.net, who came up
with two systems that both required a full redo of the logic, and thus who helped a lot in this process.

New patch version, new tarball. Another error case dataset, wrong cap, wrong max mod

New version, new tarball. Fixed bad assumption, DMI type 0 is not always before other
types, in at least one case, it is last, so can't use that as trigger to start loop.

Now using: Table at .. which is always at start of dmi output.

Also, changed size output per module to be in MB GB TB instead of all mB, since modules
are sold by GB or MB, the data should show that as well. Also shortens output.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. This version hopefully brings inxi closer to
at least making good guesses when the data is bad for ram, and hopefully will not break
too many cases where it was actually right but seemed wrong.

Unfortunately, dmidecode data simply cannot be relied on, and is FAR inferior to the type
of data inxi tries in general to present users, ie, taken directly from the system, and,
ideally, more accurate than most other tools. But in this case, there is just no way to get
the data truly accurate no matter how many hacks I add.

But if you have bad data, then submit: inxi -xx@ 14 so I can take a look at the system,
and see if I can modify the hacks to improve that data.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Attempting to handle bad extra data for max module size, sometimes
it is too big, and sometimes too small. Changed data gathering to use arrays, then print/process
the arrays once they are assembled.

Now it will get rid of any max module size if it's greater than the calculated capacity, and it
will generate an estimated capacity/max module size if they are clearly wrong because actual
module sizes are greater than listed max size, or capacity is less than greatest module sizes times
number of devices.

Not perfect, but it never is, this covers more cases now correctly than before.

maximum supported module size, and module voltage. Most systems do not have this data,
but some do. It's Type 5 item in dmidecode.

Getting the type 6 data however is too hard, and even using type 5 assumes that the 
system only has one physical memory array, but that's fine given how few systems
probably will have this information in the first place.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. Fixed man page errors, improved man page explanations of -m
features. Changed output syntax to be more consistent, now each main array line starts with:

Array-X capacity: (where X is an integer, counting from 1)

and each device line starts with:
Device-X: (where X is an integer incremented by 1 for each device, and starting at 1
for each array. I have no data sets that contain > 1 physical memory array, if one appears,
I may need to patch the output to link the array handles with the device handles explicitly.

Made memory bus width output more clear, and added in a hack to correct dmidecode output errors,
sometimes total width > data width, and sometimes data width is > total width, so using always
greatest value for total if not equal to other width.

I think this will be close to it barring any user feedback or bugs, if nothing comes to
mind within a few days, I'll move the number to the new major version, 2.2.0

but sometimes from Bank Locator info when it is more reliable based on my data samples.

Updated help menu, updated man page, now shows working -x -xx -xxx extra data. This may
change slightly over time.

Also removed speed output when No Module Installed is returned for device size. This
also wills switch off width if both total/data are empty.

This is much closer now to live 2.2.0, but I'll leave a few more tests before putting
it at 2.2.0.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Should be almost no changes for linux platforms, though I 
added in an abstracted kernel_compiler method, not just gcc, that may work on freebsd,
and in the future, it may also work if distros or kernel people start using either
clang or LLVM-GCC or LLVM for compiling linux kernels. I'd need some data sets to
show that however before adding that full linux kernel support, but the framework
is now there.

That continues the abstraction of certain features, like kernel compiler, init system,
display server. Display server still needs full data sets from mir/wayland, at least
wayland, and the bsd display servers as well, I have no idea how to get that data
at this point, but the starting framework is present anyway for that time I get
those datasets.

Almost all these changes are for darwin osx, and that is about all I will do for that
junky broken platform, they have no tools, they have no discipline when it comes to
following unix like conventions, they even use spaces in program names, like windows.

Given it has no native lspci or pciconf tool that I am aware of, or dmesg.boot, 
there's little point in putting more time into it. dmidecode does not run on darwin,
so there's nothing to learn there either, you can get a silly 3rd party program to
generate a dmidecode.bin data file that dmidecode can then read, but since that
requires not one, but two third party programs be installed, that's not going to
happen.

Next time an osx user calls this system 'unix' I will laugh.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is an attempt to make -s accurate more of the time, 
particularly with fringe or broken sensors outputs. See inxi issue 58 for details.
http://code.google.com/p/inxi/issues/detail?id=58

Added temp3, and an override to capture cases where temp3 is the actual cpu temp.

Added PECI overrides for cases like msi/asus mobos have defective CPUTIN return data.

Added core0 overrides as well, for cases where the temp returned is too low.

It is absolutely 100% guaranteed that these changes will break some outputs that were
working, but it's also certain that I believe that more wrong outputs will be corrected.

With sensors, really the only way you can get reliable sensors is to use the lm-sensors
config files for your motherboard, then set: CPU: temp and MB: temp explicitly.

inxi will always use CPU: or MB: to override anything found.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. A bug fix for btrfs, which does not internally use /dev/sdx[number]
to identify a partition, but rather the basic /dev/sdc for example.

This made -D show wrong disk used percentage.

Also, I added --total for df that have that supported, there is however an oddity which you
can see here:

df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \

--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
--exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
awk 'BEGIN {total=0} /^total/ {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

result:

 df  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \

 --exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
 awk 'BEGIN {total=0} {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

 result:
 614562236
 
 In my tests, using --total gives a greater disk user percentage than adding the results
 up manually, as inxi did before, and still does for systems without --total for df.

Strange, no? the data is in blocks, and it should of course in theory add up to exactly the
same thing. However, because --total lets df do the math, I'm going to use that for now,
unless someone can show it's not good.

inxi still falls back for bsds and older df to the standard method.

Second, fixes a bug with some file systems / usb drives
where they do not use usb- in the /dev/disk/by-id line but only wwn-
https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en
-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Online_Storage_Reconfiguration_Guide/persistent_naming.html
explains it somewhat.

the fix is adding a second if null test of the device /dev/sdx in by-path, that seems 
to fix the issue. by-path does have the usb- item, though it does not have the name
so it's not as reliable in absolute terms, but it's fine as a second step fallback

is an upstream bug, I'm adding in a quick hack that will work maybe for single core
ARM cpus, but NOT for multicores that have the same issue.

Version: 2.1.18
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-04
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version/tarball. This completes, I think, the line wrap update. -o is now handled,
unmounted drives.

IMPORTANT: some distros use inxi for detecting partitions, the syntax on the following 
have changed slightly:

HDD: per drive changes from: 1: id: to ID-1:
Partitions: per partition changes from ID: to ID-1:
Unmounted partitions: per unmounted changes from ID: to ID-1

You see the pattern, they are all the same now, and they are all numbered. I think this
is easier to read when scanning long lines of drives/partitions, or even short ones.

Also fixed a long standing oddity, not a bug, but for some weird reason, -p did not
include the location, like /dev/sda1, unless -l or -u were used. That makes no sense
so I have moved the dev/remote location output to standard -p/-P

Except for bug fixes, this completes the overally line wrap update, all lines wrap,
you can set widths with -y now, and the old issue of not fitting nicely into 80 column
wide widths is solved. Note that in some areas, p/P for example, at times if the mount
point or remote location is very long the line may still wrap, but making this perfect
is too convoluted so I'm calling it good enough now, all lines are handled reasonably well,
certainly radically better than before 2.1.0.

Version: 2.1.17
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Added -y [integer >= 80] option. This allows for absolute override
of width settings. This overrides any dynamically detected widths, as well as the globals:
COLS_MAX_CONSOLE='115'
COLS_MAX_IRC='105'
Now that inxi widths are largely dynamic in terminal, with a few lingering exceptions, it made sense
to also allow for overrides of this. This is useful in cases where for example you want to output
inxi to text file or for other purposes, or if you just want to test the widths, as in my case.

-y cannot be used with --recommends, but otherwise it works fine, with --help/-c 94-99 you have to 
put -y first in the list of options.

Example: inxi -v7 -y150 > inxi.txt will ignore the terminal settings and output the lines at basically
max length.

ESC=$(echo | tr '\n' '\033' )

new version/tarball. This corrects some subtle issues with line wraps:

Audio -A - now wrap is fully dynamic down to 80 characters, and also the expansion of ALSA
to Advanced Linux Sound System only happens if that fits in the display width.

-N/-n/-i - Most networking/ip address stuff wraps now.

-d - optical drive data wraps better now too.

This more or less completes the line wrap redo.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version/tarball. Tiny fix in debugger, it turns out that in some systems, the command:
strings --version used in the debugger results in a hang, which you can duplicate with:
strings 
alone, without any argument or info, that will hang too, so I assume if the system doesn't
have the --version parameter, strings ignores that, and basically just does what it would do
with no option, hang.

Thanks for user ypharis persistence in tracking down this issue. So far only appeared on slackware
based distros, but since the debugger should 'just work', removing the version test.

new version, attempt 2 at detecting all possible syntaxes for cards. Now using
the bus id itself to determine if the 
VGA compatible controller
3D controller
Display Controller
refer to separate chips or the same one.

Bus id gives the data needed, because the video chip, the real card, that is,
is on for example 00:05.0 the trailing .0 is the key, that's the actual card.

The audio or display controller for the same card would be for example: 00:05.1

I don't know if this is fully reliable, but it will have to do, either some cards
as is get missed, or some cards get double id'ed, unless I use a hack like this.

There's nothing else I can find but the bus id to determine that it's the same
physical device or not.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version. Big set of changes: changed all ver: and version: to v:; changed all bash
${var} to $var where appropriate to avoid extra overhead of ${..}; removed 'basename'
and replaced with ${path##*/} which avoids unnessary subshells.

Fixed dynamic line wraps on -I and -S lines, now those in most cases will work well 
down to 80 cols. 

Fixed bug in optical drives, at some point in the last few years, the kernel in /sys
changed the path to the optical drive data, added in /ata8/ (example) so both methods
are now handled. This should fix a lot of failures to show optical drive brand name etc.

Added weechat detection, trying also supybot/limnoria detection in irc client version.
There was weechat-curses, but I guess they finally dropped the -curses. Limnoria is
a fork of supybot but still uses the supybot program name, but added in limnoria too
if they get around to changing that.

More dynamic sizing tweaks, more optimization of code. Discovered that dipping into gawk
is almost 250x more expensive in terms of execution time than using bash variable. 
Will change to use bash directly as time goes along where it's safe and accurate.

Added handling to support /run paths using directories, like /run/gdm/gdm.pid for dm data.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New Version, new man. This continues the dyanamic line sizing, I'm doing these one at a
time to make it easier to test stuff one by one.

Full refactoring/reordering of top global variables, moved user/maintainer set variables
to top, and clearly identify all globals.

Changed LINE_MAX to COL_MAX but all user configuration files will stay working since
inxi now will check for that and translate them to the new variable names.

New lines fixed, -C cpu and -f cpu plus full flags. Flags output is now fully dynamic to
display screen in terminal/console. Moved cpu short flags to -x because it's not that
important in general and just clutters things  up in my opinion.

Print flags/bogomips on separate line if line greater than display width.

The rest of the lines will get a similar treatment, but it takes a bit of trial and error
for each line to get it working right.

Note that IRC line lengths are NOT dyanamic unless I can find a way to determine the column
width of irc clients, but that won't be accurate since fonts vary in widths for each character.

CPU was the worst offender in my opinion in terms of regular output wrapping to new line messily,
next will be the things with ports/chip id/card id.

Tightened up a bit more the dyanamic help / version output handler.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New feature, not new line option though. Now shows init type with -x (also shows rc
type if openrc). -xx shows init / rc version number. Change runlevel to target if
systemd and if non numeric runlevel given. Should support systemd/upstart/epoch/runit
sysvinit. Supports openrc as extra data if it's present. Rearranged -I line a bit but
really just exchanged Runlevel: for Init: v: Runlevel: default:

This is the first step, some of the init system ID methods are weak and non robust
and this may need to be revised, but it should for now identify systemd/upstart quite
accurately, and in most cases sysvinit. Note that to get sysvinit version number requires
tool: strings which in debian/ubuntu is in package binutils. I don't know the package names
for arch/fedora/etc for the recommends check tool in inxi yet.

I believe this will be good enough for a first draft version, but over time we'll get it
more fine tuned, but as it is now, it should cover at least 99% of users, which isn't bad.

Also, there's a bug in at least gtk detection in opensuse, not sure what it is, they could
be using a different syntax for the test:
pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0

returns no such package on gnome 3.10 installs, but I have no idea what package name to
test for there in this case.

So leaving gtk version bugs unhandled due to no user information or feedback, if you want
it fixed or if it works for your distro, let me know and also if it does not work, tell
me the correct commmand, with its output, to get gtk version.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Fixed a bug in Xorg where it shows drivers as unloaded when they
are actually loaded. Since we can't fix xorg, inxi will try to work around this bug by validating
one step further in the Xorg.0.log data, to confirm that drivers noted as loaded/unloaded/failed are 
actually running the display(s) of the system.

There is a possible case of error that might happen due to this change in the case of a system with
a complex xorg that uses two drivers/modules to run two different displays, ie, nvidia on one, and amd
on the other, for example, or intel/nvidia, etc. However, if that bug appears, we'll get that data set
of debugging output and fix it at that point. 

This fix repairs an existing xorg bug that is unlikely to get fixed any time soon (the call to load the
detected drivers, eg, vesa, intel, is repeated, causing a failure of driver already loaded on the second
occurance.

Script Date:  June 19 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Another stab at finally fixing the cpu / core count failures on fringe
cases. This required fixing some core logic assumptions that are not currently correct, particularly
on two cases, some xeon cpus fail to show core id for each core, showing 0 for all of them, second,
vm cpus do not show physical ids at all for at least intel, nor do they show core id. 

While we can't get HT totally reliable, particularly for vm xeon, since inxi has no way to know in
that case if a core is attached to a physical core or a virtual one, all of them being virtual in that
case, but still inxi is now reporting the correct number of cores, or threads in vm xeons, and is not
showing multicore cpus as single core, which was the main issue.

This required redoing the counter logic for the cpu/core/physical arrays, now they are set independently,
and can handle any of the others not being set, without creating an error or failure condition.

Also added in last check for a certain intel case where core id is 0 but > 1 physical cores exist, that
now also shows the correct cpu / core count.

While this is tested on many data sets of proc cpuinfo, it's still possible there is a fringe case I have
not seen that will trigger yet another unexpected behavior.

new version, new tarball. Added support for openSUSE repo syntax/location, as long as it's
zypp or yum it will work. If it's both then it will show only one I believe, if that's a possible scenario, no idea.

Added one more fix for those pesky intel vm cpu core errors, now if /proc/cpuinfo shows no siblings at all,
and no core_id, but does have physical id, it will use the count for physical id as a default for core count.

Not perfect, but better than calling a dual core cpu a single core.

There's still a lot of mysteries with vm versions of kvm cpus, for example, if you see a dual core xeon, is
that actually one core with ht, or two cores? There is no way to find that information out that I can see that is
reliable.

Version: 1.9.8
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  June 14 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Some subtle bug fixes, a kvm virtual machine uses disk id in 
/proc/partitions of 253, which made the disk totals fail to show up at all. Added that in.

Moved sourcing of configuration files to right after initialize_data so that some variables
can be forced to different values before the next set of system/app checks.

This is to allow specifically turning off, for some headless servers where $DISPLAY is not
null due to a bash configuration bug, these:
B_SHOW_X_DATA='false'
B_RUNNING_IN_X='false'

Setting those two to false in inxi.conf will turn off all the X checks etc even if the $DISPLAY
is set to non null.

Added in support for ksplice kernel version, requires installed uptrack-uname, if that is
present and if uptrack-name kernel version is different from uname then it will add (ksplice)
to kernel version string, and use ksplice kernel version. Also created a single function
get_kernel_version for use by short form/long form inxi output.

For intel xeon cpus, trying a work around for a bug in /proc/cpuinfo which fails to show core_id
or physical_id for cpus, using siblings / 2 for xeons with no actual core counts.

Fixed a bug that made fixes for multimounted partitions fail for disk used. Added in support
for also excluding single partitions mounted to different places.

Also fixed grsec kernel different handling of partitions in /proc/partition and df -hTP, doesn't use
standard partition numbering. This can't be perfect because inxi cannot know what the actual 
disk sizes are, but it's an ok guess. example: /dev/xvdac (uses 'c' instead of '3' for partition,
and does not show anything for disk itself.

New tarball, version, man page. Improved remote weather, now it uses -W, and deprecated -! location=..

That was too hard to type and too hard to remember. Also do more dyanamic reordering of weather
output, depending on how much data is present, and how many x options are used.

Added error handling for generic deprecated options, and for options that do not have the correct
syntax for OPTARG, like with -W.

This should about do it for the weather option for now unless I missed something somewhere.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Unless disabled by distribution maintainers, offers
weather -w option. With -x, -xx-, -xxx, shows more information. Basic line is just weather
and system time there. -x adds time zone, which is useful for servers, particurly web servers.
-x also adds wind speed. -xx adds humidity and barometric pressure. -xxx adds a possible new line, 
if data is available, heat index, wind chill, and dew point. 
-xxx also adds a line for location (blocked by irc/-z) / weather observation time.

-z filter applies as usual to location data, removes it in irc by default. -Z overrides override.

The api this uses is probably going to be dropped at some point, so this is just going to work 
while it works, then it will need to be updated at some point, so don't get very attached to it.

Also adds option to, with -w: -! location=<location string>
This lets users send an alternate location using either <city,state> or <postal code>
or <latitude,longitude> (commas for city,state and latitude,longitude are not optional, and the order
must be as listed.

If There is a developer flag if distro maintainers do not want this enabled, simply set:
B_ALLOW_WEATHER='false'
before packaging and the weather feature will be disabled.

Script Date:  May 3 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Fixed a small issue that would create a wrong reporting of disk
useage if bind mounts are used, ie, multiple binds to a single mount. Now inxi will
check a list of the previously used partitions before adding the size of the used space
to the total used, if the partition has already been used it will skip it. This was/is
a quick and dirty fix, but it's totally fine I believe and should resolve two separate 
issues:

1. use of bind mount method, where multiple partition names are bound to the same partition
2. accidental dual mounting to the same partition.

partitions section will still show the same data, ie, if bind is used, it will show all
the bind mounts even when they are attached/bound to a partition that is already listed.
This seems useful information, though maybe we can get the key word 'bind' in there somehow,
but for now I won't worry about that issue, that's just a nice to have, not a bug.

linux driver version handling, now only trimming off number from bsd drivers.

Patch Version: 00

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Improved B_ALLOW_UPDATES handling, now if set to false,
turns off all -h and -H menu options for updating. Also triggers an error message
if you use -U or -! <10-16/http://>.

Distro maintainers, take note, if you used the B_ALLOW_UPDATES flag, you no longer
need to change the code anywhere, the error messages and blocking the -h output for
update features is automatic as soon as the flag is set to 'false'.

I needed to change the -! handling because -! is now also being used for extra features 
like -! 31 and -! 32 and probably more stuff in the future, plus the -! 30 used by 
things like the inxi gui tool being worked on by trash80.

Also included in this version are more bsd changes, including initial function for pciconf
data parsing, this will be used for -A, -G, and -N options for card data.

Further bsd improvements are better error/no data available messages for -D and -o.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, updated man page, new tarball.

Fixed partition bug that could falsely identify a remote filesystem like nfs as /dev fs

Added two options: 
-! 31 - Turns off Host section of System line. This is useful if you want to post output
from server without posting its name.
-! 32 - Turns on Host section if it has been disabled by user configuration file
B_SHOW_HOST='false'

Added missing CPU data message, fixed missing cpu cache/bogomips output, turned off
bogomips if null for bsd systems because bogomips is a linux kernel feature.

Added N/A for no memory report, this would mainly hit bsd systems where user has no
permissions to use sysctl or has no read rights for /var/run/dmesg.boot.

Many fixes for partitions, now for bsd, if available, uses gpart list to get uuid/label
Added support for raid file system syntax in bsd, now excludes main raid device name, 
and adds a flag to raiddevice/partitionname type so output can identify it as a raid
slice/partition.

In man page, added -! 31 / -! 32 sections, and some other small edits.

Added bsd raid line error message, added bsd sensors line error message.

Many other small bug fixes that should make linux more robust in terms of missing
data, and better/cleaner output for bsd.

Version: 1.8.37
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  February 11 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This update fixes a recent bug report with ancient dmidecode versions, that do not
properly support the -s option. Now -M uses only one method for dmidecode, manual construction of the Machine
data from the raw dmidecode file. The file output is also parsed a bit to make it more consistently reliable
for inxi purposes.

This update also includes all recent bsd branch updates, including the new #!/usr/bin/env bash on top which
lets inxi run in any environment without changes. Also for bsd, sets sed -i/sed -i '' global value, which 
means that now all the branches are the same, except the bsd branches will contain the most recent tests
and bsd handling. 

As each step is reached, I'll release a new inxi that should be stable, this is the first one however that
can be used as is, no changes, for bsd, debian kfreebsd, and linux systems.

Pleasen note that most bsd features are either incomplete or missing completely at this point, but it's a
start.

Some initial changes as well to help options to show more correct linux or bsd terms. These will be updated
as time permits, it is a long process.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. All bug fixes and cleanup preparing to support bsd systems, including
kfreebsd from Debian.

Cleaned up all sed and grep that will be used by bsds, added more granular flag for bsd types.

Cleaned up and corrected issues between bsd/linux, more escapes and tests added to drop error
counts in bsds. 

Please note that you must use the inxi from branches/bsd for true bsds because sed has extra -i ''
added, and has the proper #!/usr/local/bin/bash

Added -! 16 for gnubsd download/update, that's for gnu bsd systems like gnu/kfreebsd from debian.

That retains the top #!/bin/bash path, and also uses gnu sed so no -i '' syntax.

Moved some grep -o to gawk or sed to avoid using gnu grep unnecessarily, leaving gnu grep where
it will be linux only, for example parsing a /proc file.

Fixed tty irc bugs for bsds and linux, now should show the right console size for both, ideally.

New version, new tarball. Note, this is a refactor release only, and features the core bsd
support built in, although inxi will not run in bsd unless the top: #!/bin/bash is changed
to #!/usr/local/bin/bash

The actual bsd branch can be grabbed from: 
http://inxi.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd/inxi
then you can keep that version updated using: inxi -! 15 
which will grab the latest bsd version from the svn server.

This release also fixes a lot of small bugs that testing for bsd support exposed, but functionally
most people should see no difference, I just want to get this version up because there are
so many small changes that it's worth having a release.

I was going to have the fixed dmidecode for old systems in 1.8.35 but that will have to wait til
1.8.36

Linux users should see no real changes, except maybe a thing or two will work in certain circumstances 
when it didn't before, like showing MHz on ARM cpus on short inxi.

why not handle it?

Continuing fixes for ARM cpus, it was noted that short form inxi failed to show cpu speed
derived from bogomips. That's because of the old min/max output that short form used.

Updated that section to now use N/A as flag, and if N/A for min/max speed, use the speed
given from first cpu array index, the one derived from bogomips for ARM/razberry pi.

Note that there is still no other ARM /proc/cpuinfo available to see if the razberry pi
fixes work for all ARM cpus, but the fixes will stop hangs and endless loops at worst,
and may also show some type of cpu speeds for ARM cpus that are not in razpi devices.

Bug fix, new version, new tarball.

quick work around fix for razberrie pi, get cpu data hung on arm /proc/cpuinfo because
it doesn't use the standard processor : [digit] format, but uses a string in the
processor : field, which then hangs inxi which was expecting an integer.

Corrected this with a work around, but it will require a lot more ARM /proc/cpuinfo samples
before the support for ARM can be considered stable.

For cpu speed, following wikipedia, used bogomips being equal to 1x cpu speed, to derive cpu speed.

Better than nothing I guess, but will be wrong in other cases, particularly with dual core arm.
