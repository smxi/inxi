Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball. This is an attempt at a fix for issue #129

Because I don't want to break existing cpu logic, I just added in a rizen switch,
which will just use cpu_core_count value, then trigger HT output.

This fix may or may not work, but the issue poster vanished and has not followed up.

For now I'm keeping this a Ryzen specific adjustment, but it may be safe to extend
it further, that is, if siblings > 1 && siblings = 2 * cores then it's HT.

Version: 2.3.49
Patch Version: 00
Script Date: 2017-11-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball, new man page. This is the first attempt to correct an
issue a forum poster raised, which is the fact that despite the fact that GNU/Linux
has had reasonably ok zfs support for years now, inxi only tested for zfs on bsd 
systems.

This has been corrected. Due to the complexity of handling software raid, inxi
will now test first for ZFS data, if none is found, it will then test for 
/proc/mdstat.

In a perfect world I'd like to have full dynamic Raid support, but I'm missing
all the key ingredients required to add that:

1. systems to test on
2. software raid, I don't use it
3. data collection for non mdraid and zfs software raid, including the values
possible to gather from all non software raid.

Basically, the only way I'd extend -R raid option is if I get direct ssh access to 
a machine that uses the alternate software raid type, otherwise it would take
forever to figure out the options.

Since the number of people who might be actually running zfs and mdraid and 
using inxi probably numbers in the 10 globally, I figured this solution was a fine
way to handle adding zfs without messing up mdraid, which is more common on linux.

It also does not break BSDs, since bsds as far as I know don't use mdraid, and don't
have /proc/mdraid in the first place.

Also redid the man page to add -! 41, -! 42, -! 43, -! 44 options, which bypass 
curl, fetch, wget, and all of them, respectively. Plus making the lines less wide.

That should make those people who actually use 80 column wide vi as an editor 
happy, lol.

Version: 2.3.46
Patch Version: 00
Script Date: 2017-11-26
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------

New version, new tarball. Added an optional downloader: Perl HTTP::Tiny

Note that this is the last choice because it's slow, the order has been revised:

1. curl
2. wget
3. fetch
4. Perl 5 HTTP::Tiny
5. OpenBSD ftp

wget has been downgraded due to the recent 1.19-2 bug with wget -O that did 
not get resolved quickly, and which should never have been released since 
that's a basic wget action, which means they aren't testing gnu wget the way 
they should be.

All inxi downloaders can now use this option. However, in my tests it's signicantly 
slower to use HTTP::Tiny than curl or wget, so inxi will test for the downloaders 
in that order. While -i uses dig as it's primary IP tool, if dig is not installed, 
the IP will follow the same downloader priority. -U and -w/-W use downloaders.

Because HTTP::Tiny is optional, and is merely used if wget/curl/fetch are not 
installed, I would not consider Perl to be a real dependency yet, just an option, so 
I guess for packager maintainers, Perl should be added as a recommends, or a 
dependency if you want to fully support the debugger options (Core Modules).

While I'm still not sure which Perl modules I'm going to be using, I'm sticking 
for now to Core Modules, the standard, with some experimental exceptions that 
would only be used if the user had them present.

Long term the goal is to get rid of as many dependencies as possible, replacing 
them were possible with Perl tools, but this is going to take forever, if it
ever happens, so don't hold your breath.

In the future, I expect more and more components that were gawk to be rewritten
to Perl (Core Modules), slowly, however, very slowly.

Updated --recommends to indicate the downloader options more clearly as well.

Added new options for bypassing curl (-! 41), fetch (-! 42) wget (-! 43), or
curl, fetch, and wget (-! 44) to disable all of them. This is in case one of 
those is broken or you want to test Perl downloader, mostly.

Also cleaned up debugger output and made debugger portable to other scripts.

New version, new tarball. Updated the inxi upater options, removed some legacy 
branches, simplified the options. This corresponds to updates on github where
I'm finally bringing the alternate location self updater back into operational
state after a long dormant period.

Also, and this may be of interest to some maintainers, please note, there is
a new branch: master-plain which does NOT have the gz files inxi.1.gz and
inxi.tar.gz

If you want to avoid the big clones, you can use that branch with this command:
git clone https://github.com/smxi/inxi --branch master-plain --single-branch

And that should only track the basic 3 files: inxi inxi.1 and inxi.changelog

This fixes issue #94

tell, so far, nvme is the only disk type that has firmware revision data.

Added support for nvme disk temperature as well, that requires the cli tool nvme.

Script Date: 2017-08-23
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Deprecated xiin uploader, which completes the deprecation 
of the xiin.py tool, which is going to become obsolete when python 3 fully replaces python 2.

Since the odds of perl being around and stable are far higher than the odds of xiin.py
even working on python 3, I'm getting ahead of the race. Plus Perl is nicer to work with.

And Perl is a lot faster. I mean, a lot. Not slightly.

And it also works on much older systems, and does not have that Python version < 2.6 
failure due to changing Python syntax even between sub versions. xiin.py never ran on
Python 2.5 even when it was relatively recent, which is one reason I'm removing all Python
from inxi.

Basically xiin.py worked only on Python 2.6 or 2.7, period.

Oh, and also handled issue #115 by not making -B show -M data.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes issue #119 

The issue was not so much with xiin.py as with some new values in /sys that would 
hang tree traverse, however, in order to remove the python dependency (except for
uploading -xx@ debugger data, until I can figure out how to do it with Perl), I 
rewrote the tree traverse tool into Perl, which also makes it a lot faster and 
easier to work with.

This issue appeared on kernel 4.11 as far as I can tell, some new values in /sys make 
the traverse hang if it tries to read the values, **/parameters/** and **/debug/** seem 
to be the main culprits, but inxi doesn't need that data anyway for debugging purposes
so it's just excluded.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. This corrects many 80 column width line wraps, including on:
-o, -p, -l, -u, -P, -S, -G, -N, -A

Now most output should tend to not wrap, though some strings are unpredictable and 
will have to be trimmed by adding them to the min size trimmers one by one.

But it's much better than it was.

Note the following changes required to make the wraps more consistent:

-S - the gcc/bits have been made separate, like: bits: 32 gcc: 5.3
-C - the new microarchitecture -x option now is: arch: K7 [for example]
     cache wraps to next line with arch. with -f, bmips now shows on same line as 
     arch/cache

Note that while /proc/cpuinfo has the family/model id in decimal, the values are actually generally

-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This corrects a case I'm seeing where wayland/mir are running desktop 
but Xorg has not started, which means inxi can't get the video driver from Xorg.0.log as with X.

Added in extra data collection from lspci -v to include the driver for graphics card. this is 
only used, for now, if the initial Xorg based driver test works.

Note that this may also work for systems that have not yet started X out of X, in console, I'm 
not sure about that, but the graphics driver reporting should be improved.

Note that I'm not yet linking the driver to the specific card/device, it's just going to show 
in a comma separated list, I couldn't find multi card systems where the card types are different, 
like amd gpu with nvidia card, for example.

But this should correct an issue, at least to start, with expanding wayland support for systems 
that don't use or have not started the desktop with Xorg/X11 etc.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Bug fix for GLX/OpenGL output. There was an unhandled case with 
core profile data being null, which in turn triggered a bash oddity, where if the IFS is 
\n for an array, and if the value of one element is '', then bash ignores that and does 
not simply set an empty array key as you'd expect. The correction was to change the IFS 
to ^, which worked fine for empty array values.

However, since this bug will impact anyone with empty opengl core profile data, I recommend 
updating inxi.

Also, added support for two smaller wm, Sawfish and Afterstep.

This is a good source for lists of wm:  http://www.xwinman.org/ http://www.xwinman.org/others.php 

However, that does not show how to ID it, so i have to do it on a case by case, but I'll
add an issue for showing how to get your wm of choice if it's missing to inxi.

Also, changed the slightly inaccurate:

GLX Renderer: .....GLX Version: .... 

to

OpenGL: renderer: ...... version: .....

that most multi-monitor setups use :0 for both monitors, depending on how it's setup.

This will also let users see any desktop information based on xrop -root output, but it will 
depend how it works based on how environmental variables have been set. gnome and kde, which use XDG for 
primary detection would not work, for example.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. This corrects an issue I noticed a while ago, glxinfo and xpdyinfo
used to not work as root in X, but they do now. So I've removed the root tests for graphics 
output, and now only rely on the returned data to determine the output when in X. Out of X 
behavior remains the same.

Note that at some point I'll have to see if wayland systems have usable reporting tools to get 
screen resolution, opengl info, and so on, but that will have to come one step at a time.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. Shows as default OpenGL core profile version number. 
-xx option will show OpenGL compatibility version number as well, though that's largely useless
information for most users, thus the -xx. Note that this reverses the default, which previously
showed OpenGL version, which is actually the compatibility version.

This should resolve #105 pull request, though it does it differently, by switching the default 
output to what is more relevant, and offering the compatibility version as an optional output item.

Note that much of the glx information will probably change to more neutral terms once wayland support 
starts growing, and systems without xwayland etc libraries appear.

Further note that non free drivers showed the OpenGL core profile version numbers all along, so really 
this simply corrects misleading output for free drivers.

Version: 2.3.12
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2017-06-06
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, man page, tarball. ARM cpu core count bug fix. First attempt to add Wayland 
and compositor support. 

This finally implements a first try at mir/wayland detection, along with basic handling of actual 
display server type output. 

New output for Display Server:  Display Server: x11 (X.Org 1.19.0) driver: nvidia

Note that since almost all current Wayland systems will have X.org also installed, for the time 
being, the data in the parentheses will be from X.org regardless of what display server is detected running 
the actual desktop. Out of the desktop, console, the only thing that will show is x data..

No other data is available to me yet until I get way more debugger data so I can see what information the various 
implementations of wayland without x tools actually makes available, my guess is it won't be much.

Also experimental -xx option: -G shows compositor, but only for wayland/mir currently.

I have no idea if this will work at all, but it's worth giving it a try as a rough beginning to
start handling the wide range of wayland compositors being created.

This feature will probably take several versions to get stable.

Also added new debugger data collector data for wayland information, but the pickings are slim, to
put it mildly.

Version: 2.3.11
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2017-05-31
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. This corrects several oversights of the 2.3.10 IPv6 update.

Now there is an -x option for -i that will show the additioanl IPv6 address data for scope global,
temporary, and site. Also a fallback for unhandled scope: unknown. If the tool 'ip' is used, it will
filter out the deprecated temp site/global addresses, ifconfig tool does not appear to offer this 
option.

Also changed is that now ipv6 address always shows, it's not an -x option. Probably about time to
start rolling out ip v6 data to users now that ip v6 is starting, slowly, to be used more.

Another small change, the link address for ipv6 is changed from ip-v6: to ip-v6-link so that it's 
more clear which IP v6 address it is.

The last commit had a significant logic error in it that did not distinguish between the link address,
which is what should have only shown, and the remaining possible addresses.

I've tried to get a basic bsd support, but it's difficult to know the variants of ifconfig output syntax

=====================================================================================
Version: 2.3.6
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2016-12-19
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is a significant change, but inxi should handle it smoothly.

While default configs remain in /etc/inxi.conf, the user overrides now use the following order of tests:

1. XDG_CONFIG_HOME / XDG_DATA_HOME for the config and log/debugger data respectively. 

2. Since those will often be blank, it then uses a second priority check:
   $HOME/.config $HOME/.local/share to place the inxi data directory, which was previously here:
   $HOME/.inxi
   
3. If neither of these cases are present, inxi will default to its legacy user data: $HOME/.inxi as before

In order to make this switch transparent to users, inxi will move the files from .inxi to the respective
.config/ .local/share/inxi directories, and remove the .inxi directory after to cleanup.

Also, since I was fixing some path stuff, I also did issue 77, manual inxi install not putting man pages in
/usr/local/share/man/man1, which had caused an issue with Arch linux inxi installer. Note that I can't help
users who had a manual inxi install with their man page in /usr/share/man/man1 already, because it's too risky
to guess about user or system intentions, this man location correction will only apply if users have never
installed inxi before manually, and have no distro version installed, unlike the config/data directory, 
which does update neatly with output letting users know the data was moved.

Note that if users have man --path set up incorrectly, it's possible that the legacy man page would show up
instead, which isn't good, but there was no perfect fix for the man issue so I just picked the easiest way, 
ignoring all man pages installed into /usr/share/man/man1 and treating them as final location, otherwise
using if present the /usr/local/share/man/man1 location for new manual  install users.

Also, for users with existing man locations and an inxi manually installed, you have to update to inxi current,
then move your man file to /usr/local/share/man/man1, then update man with: mandb command (as root), after that
inxi will update to the new man location.

Also added some more XDG debugger data as well to cover this for future debugger data.

This closes previous issue #77 (man page for manual inxi install does not go into /usr/local/share/man/man1) and 
issue 101, which I made today just to force the update.

Just as a side note, I find this absurd attempt at 'simplifying by making more complex and convoluted' re the XDG 
and .config and standard nix . file to be sort of tragic, because really, they've just made it all way more complicated,
and since all 3 methods can be present, all the stuff has to be tested for anyway, so this doesn't make matters cleaner
at all, it's just pointless busywork that makes some people happy since now there's even more rules to follow, sigh.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This will matter to some users, inxi had failed to add 'modesetting' 
graphics driver, so it would not show in output, which causes support issues for users of that specific
driver, like some cases of Intel. Also inxi would always have failed to show it unloaded in cases where
radeon/nouveau were used but it had been loaded by xorg to begin with. So probably worth updating packages
I'd say.

Now -M shows device type, like desktop, laptop, notebook, server, blade, vm (and tries to get vm type).

vm detection will take more work, for now I'm just going for the main ones used, but it will certainly
miss some because it's hard to detect them in some cases unless you use root features. Also note, in
most cases a container I believe will display as a vm, which is fine for now.

For BSDs, and older linux, there is a dmidecode fallback detection as well.

UEFI [Legacy] for UEFI booting in bios legacy mode, and BIOS for all others. Hopefully this will

-B option now shows, if available, battery data. Quite good data for systems 
with /sys battery data, only rudimentary for systems using dmidecode (BSDs). 
dmidecode has no current voltage/charge/current supported capacity.

Main row shows charge and condition. Condition shows you have much capacity the 
battery currently has vs its design capacity. Charge shows the Wh/percent of 
current capacity of battery (NOT the rated design capacity).

-x adds battery vendor/model info, and battery status (like, charging, discharging, 
full).

-xx adds battery serial number and voltage information. Note that voltage information
is presented as Current Voltage / Designed minimum voltage.

-xxx adds battery chemistry (like Li-ion), cycles (note: there's a bug somewhere in
that makes the cycle count always be 0, I don't know if that's in the batteries,
the linux kernel, but it's not inxi, just FYI, the data is simply 0 always in all 
my datasets so far.

For dmidecode output, the location of the batter is also shown in -xxx

I will do this commit once for googlecode, and once for github, after that, 
all commits will go only to github.

inxi moves to github, despite my dislike of for profit source repos, and git,
I decided that I just don't have the time or energy to do it right, so I'm going
to use github.

The project is already moved, though I have left inxi up for the time being on 
code.google.com/p/inxi until I move the wiki to http://smxi.org

Everything is pretty much the same, the project url is:

#kde-devel, now using kf5-config --version  which gives similar output to kded4 --version

I use this for both 4 and 5, but since 4 has worked fine for years, I'll just use this for 5
and later.

Version: 2.2.24
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2015-06-15
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version, new tarball. Adapted to deal with yet another silly pointless change from
normal, in this case, sddm decided that using a .pid or .lock file in /run was too easy
so they changed to some session id type string in the /run/sddm/ directory.

Speaking for myself, I find such pointless changes from anything resembling normal behaviors
to the reason that gnu freedesktop systems will never achieve significant desktop use globally.

Also, in the same vein, added debuggers to try to figure out what plasma5/kde 5 is using
internally to give command line version information. Again, something pointless internally
was changed, thus breaking something that had faintly resembled an api, which is of course
why desktop gnu linux will never actually take off, developers in the real world have no
interest in chasing after such pointless and never ending churn in even the most trivial 
areas of the OS, let alone the core.

inxi remains however as a log of this ongoing churn and lack of discipline, and so remains
an interesting process of observation, and a way for users to try to avoid the constant
changes in simple system queries that should really never change, so I can see a reason
to keep it going since it's obvious that the actual foss ecosystem itself will not and apparently
cannot grasp that it is the lack of stable apis, methods, etc, that has kept desktop gnu linux
from achieving any actual real world success or popularity, and that is the actual problem
that should be fixed, not some pointless internal change to something.

On the source repo front, maintainers, I still can't find an acceptable alternative to the
impending shutdown of googlecode. github is a for profit venture that people who seem totally
void of any sense of history believe is actually going to be around longer than say, sourceforge,
or googlecode, as a legitimate source hosting site.

I'd welcome any suggestions. So far all the options are bad that I can find.

Top preference is svn, but if git is the absolute only other choice for an otherwise good option,
I'd consider git, but it's a horrible option for inxi because of how inxi development and debugging
works, vs how git works. ie, svn branches are perfect, git branches are totally wrong.

I may end up just hosting the svn on my own servers to avoid having to move yet again when the next
for profit flakey site decides to close up or monetize the source hosting.

The original idea of googlecode was for google to 'pay its dues to the foss community', but apparently
they got bored with that idea, plus of course, the ongoing total failure of google to deal with 
automated spam, which has always been a huge bug in the core google corporate culture. But googlecode
was by far the best option I've come across, it was done by a deep pocketed corporation not for profit
for pretty good reasons, and was never intended to be a profit center, which is the closest I could
see for a non free option. 

Setting up svn gui stuff however is a royal pain and requires ongoing maintainance for the life of
the software, which is NOT fun, nor will I sign up for that obligation.

I may end up moving to github anyway, even though git truly sucks for inxi and myself, but it's an 
idea I find fairly vile, apparently free software (sic) authors seem to have no grasp of the concept
of fredom when it comes to source code hosting, judging by the absurd popularity of github as the
default go to source repo. Their website is pathetic as well, which isn't very promising.

So we'll see where it goes, I think I have until august to decide what to do for source hosting.

Since I'm old enough to have seen sourceforge and now googlecode do the same thing, along with a lot
of other options, to say github won't do this too is delusional, what you can almost certainly say is it 
will do it, the only question is when. But, just as Linus did with his non free linux kernel version
control, people will stick with the non free stuff until you realize you can't use it anymore, because 
it is non free. Free software hosted on non free source repos is to me one of the most absurd and
stupid things I've ever heard of to be honest.

Script Date:  2015-05-30
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Modified slightly -tc and -tm output to fix a 
pet peeve of mine. Now, if -I, -b, -F, or anything that can trigger the memory: used/total
in Information line is not used, -tm will always show the system used/total ram data on the 
first line of the Memory item of -t output.

Also, if -xtc (trigger ram data in cpu output) is used, and -I is not triggered, and -tm is
not triggered, will also show system used/total ram data on the cpu first line.

I'd found it odd that this data did not appear when -tcm or -tm or -xtc were used, so this is
now fixed. I used the -t option a fair amount to find memory/cpu use issues, and usually I
don't use the option with other options, so the lack of total system ram data was odd.

Fixed bugs in Epoch init system detection, caused false positives in systems booted on

Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-11-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Very small update, added sddm id to dm detecfion. Because Arch linux, 
at least on the system I got data from, is not using .pid/.lock extensions, but other systems
are, I'm adding sddm AND sddm.pid detection. This required changing the id to use explicit -f
for test, not the previous -e, which will force only files, not directories, to trigger yes case.

No other changes, but it's worth updating to this because distros may start using sddm in the not so
distant future, it's beta currently though.

New version, tarball. Debian has for some reason broken procps / uptime support, for
as of yet unknown reasons, so rather than wait to see the bug resolved, I'm just removing
uptime as a depenendency, though this is a short term hack only because we don't know
why it was removed from procps or if that was just a mistake, or if other things as well might
be vanishing from procps. Am leaving in however uname as dependency because inxi cannot
determine what platform it is when it starts without that.

Added hard disk total/percent used for BSDs, sort of.

Now the short form, the -b/-v1 form, and the -C forms are all similar.

Also, added a few hacks to try to extract cpu max speed from cpu model string in
either sysctl -a OR /var/run/dmesg.boot data in freebsd/openbsd. Sometimes it may
work if that data was in the model string. It's a hack, but will do until we get
better data sources or they update their sources to list more data.

Version: 2.2.5
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-09-16
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This fixes a long standing weakness with min/max cpu speed
handling. Or rather, non handling, since that data only showed in rare cases on short form
(inxi no args) output. Now it uses /sys query to determine min/max speed of cpu, and uses
that data to override any other min/max data discovered.

Still uses /proc/cpuinfo for actual speeds per core. The assumption in this is that all
cares will have the same min/max speeds, which is generally going to be a safe assumption.

Now in short form, inxi, output, it will show actual speed then (max speed) or just (max)
if actual speed matches max speed. Same for -b short CPU output.

For long, -C output, shows max speed before the actual cpu core speeds per core. 

With -xx, and in multi cpu/core systems only, shows if available min/max speeds.

Note that not all /sys have this data, so it doesn't show any N/A if it's missing.

permit wget/curl/(openbsd ftp)/(bsd fetch) interchangeably.

This lets more standard downloader defaults in bsds, as well as curl on gnu/linux systems
without triggering an error of missing wget.

1. Fixed cpu core issues on bsds, now shows core count + if > 1, cpus total.

2. Now shows OS instead of Distro on short/long output, since each bsd is an OS.

3. fixed vmstat issues for used memory outputs

-m/-M would always show requires root for dmidecode no matter what. Also improved dmidecode
error messages/handling.

Also, a fix for no display card data, now shows as expected no card data

Most other fixes are for bsd, mostly openbsd.

1. Added a class for network devices in freebsd pciconf

2. Added -r support for openbsd

3. Fixed some cpu issues for openbsd

4. Fixed an issue in openbsd/freebsd where client version data failed to get cleaned

5. Changed inxi short form output for bsds to show OS data instead of kernel data.

6. BSDs, maybe all, different syntax in xorg.0.log made unloaded gfx drivers not show, 
   that is fixed now.
   
-p fixed file system type in -p/-P for openbsd, now shows.

-I / inxi short - fixed used memory, did not show in openbsd, now does.

-f fixed cpu flags in openbsd, now works

-C corrected corrupted cpu data outputs, in openbsd at least, maybe also freebsd

-C added an openbsd hack to sometimes show cpu L2 cache

-m/-M fixed/improved dmidecode error handling for all systems

Version: 2.2.00
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-08-18
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball, man page. Maintainers, this is the official release of -m feature.

I have collected enough datasamples to allow for reasonably fine grained corrections, estimates,
warnings about unreliable capacity now, and have fixed all major failures. 

Also, because this stuff is filled out by people somewhere, or not, some fields often are just
empty, or contain the default values, ie, they are worthless. inxi shows N/A for those situations,
it means there is really no actual data to show you.

This feature, sadly, well never be totally reliable, because dmi data is frankly junk, especially
dmi type 5 and 16, which is what is supposed to tell you total capacity of memory array, and the
maximum module size (type 5). However, this data is totally random, often it is right, sometimes
it is wrong. Sometimes type 5 is right and type 16 is wrong, sometimes the other way. And since
type 5 is only present in some systems, it's not reliable anyway.

What is reliable and always right is the actually installed memory per device, ie, sticks. I have
not seen any errors in that, so that seems to be actually coming from the system itself. type 5 / 16
sadly are clearly entered in manually by some poorly paid engineers out there in the world, and are
often total fictions, either far too small, or far too big, or whatever.

inxi will attempt to correct all clear logic errors, and whenever it changes the listed data from 
type 5/16, it notes either (est) or (check). (est) means it is a good guess, one I am comfortable making,
(check) means it is either an unreliable guess, or that what the system is reporting is so unlikely that
even though inxi is showing it, it doubts it could actually be true, or at least, it thinks you
should check this yourself. 

-m has 3 extra data options, -x prints the part number, if found, and the max module size, if type 5
is present. inxi does NOT attempt to guess at max module size based on what is installed, it only will
correct a listed max module size if installed modules are > than listed max size. Usually part numbers,
if present, are all you need to order a new stick.

-xx shows serial number, manufacturer (often empty, or just random alphanumeric identifiers, but sometimes
they list the actual company name, which is helpful. It also shows, if type 5 data is present, single/double
bank.

-xxx as usual shows largely useless data that may be of interest to soemone, like if ram type is synchronous, 
memory bus width data, and module voltage (type 5 data).

This feature will never be reliable I am sad to say because the source data itself is random and much
has been filled out, or not filled out, by engineering drones somewhere out there in the underpaid
world. The ranges of errors are so wide that inxi just has to check what is possible, reasonable, unlikely,
etc, to generate its numbers. In other words, this is NOT just parsing dmidecode output, that is the raw
material only, sad to say.

So this is it, for better or worse. All bug / issue reports with this MUST come with a full:
inxi -xx@14 
hardware data upload, run as root. 

Also, much to my annoyance, this feature requires root, since /dev/mem needs root to be read, and I assume
the dmi table, so that is a departure from normal inxi standards, as is the low quality input, and thus,
output, data, though I can guarantee that what inxi tells you is in most cases on average more accurate than
what dmidecode tells you, since dmidecode simply prints out what it finds in the dmi table, and nothing else,
in whatever order it finds it, from what I can see, ie, you also cannot trust the order of dmidecode output.

I had been hoping that /sys would start to contain memory data like it does mobo/system data, but it never
happened so I finally decided to just do the ram thing, require dmidecode, require root/sudo, and that's
that.

There will be issue reports, you can help them by looking up the mobo stats/specs yourself and listing them
in the issue, so I don't have to do it. I use the tool at crucial.com which is very accurate and also very 
complete in terms of all possible hardware out there. 

I would trust that tool before trusting the companies that have the least reliable data, like ASUS.

Much thanks to everyone who is contributing datasets, and the distros, particularly siduction, that really 
were very helpful in this process, by finding more and more failure cases that helped me start to tighten
the logic, and make it more and more robust. Special thanks to Mikaela, of #smxi irc.oftc.net, who came up
with two systems that both required a full redo of the logic, and thus who helped a lot in this process.

Version: 2.1.96
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-08-14
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. This version hopefully brings inxi closer to
at least making good guesses when the data is bad for ram, and hopefully will not break
too many cases where it was actually right but seemed wrong.

Unfortunately, dmidecode data simply cannot be relied on, and is FAR inferior to the type
of data inxi tries in general to present users, ie, taken directly from the system, and,
ideally, more accurate than most other tools. But in this case, there is just no way to get
the data truly accurate no matter how many hacks I add.

But if you have bad data, then submit: inxi -xx@ 14 so I can take a look at the system,
and see if I can modify the hacks to improve that data.

Version: 2.1.95
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-08-13
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Attempting to handle bad extra data for max module size, sometimes
it is too big, and sometimes too small. Changed data gathering to use arrays, then print/process
the arrays once they are assembled.

Now it will get rid of any max module size if it's greater than the calculated capacity, and it
will generate an estimated capacity/max module size if they are clearly wrong because actual
module sizes are greater than listed max size, or capacity is less than greatest module sizes times
number of devices.

Not perfect, but it never is, this covers more cases now correctly than before.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Realized that I can on some systems also add
maximum supported module size, and module voltage. Most systems do not have this data,
but some do. It's Type 5 item in dmidecode.

Getting the type 6 data however is too hard, and even using type 5 assumes that the 
system only has one physical memory array, but that's fine given how few systems
probably will have this information in the first place.

Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-08-13
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page. Fixed man page errors, improved man page explanations of -m
features. Changed output syntax to be more consistent, now each main array line starts with:

Array-X capacity: (where X is an integer, counting from 1)

and each device line starts with:
Device-X: (where X is an integer incremented by 1 for each device, and starting at 1
for each array. I have no data sets that contain > 1 physical memory array, if one appears,
I may need to patch the output to link the array handles with the device handles explicitly.

Made memory bus width output more clear, and added in a hack to correct dmidecode output errors,
sometimes total width > data width, and sometimes data width is > total width, so using always
greatest value for total if not equal to other width.

I think this will be close to it barring any user feedback or bugs, if nothing comes to
mind within a few days, I'll move the number to the new major version, 2.2.0

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is closer to final release. Removed Bank/Slot separate
items and am now just generating one: Locator item, usually from Slot/DIMM locator info,
but sometimes from Bank Locator info when it is more reliable based on my data samples.

Updated help menu, updated man page, now shows working -x -xx -xxx extra data. This may
change slightly over time.

Also removed speed output when No Module Installed is returned for device size. This
also wills switch off width if both total/data are empty.

This is much closer now to live 2.2.0, but I'll leave a few more tests before putting
it at 2.2.0.

New version, new tarball, new man page. Finally, after all these years, initial memory/ram
support. This feature requires dmidecode, and usually that needs to be run as root.

Significantly improved dmidecode error handling and output, and have as 2.1.90 testing/initial
release basic ram data. 

In subsequent releases, extra info for -x and -xx and -xxx will be added as well to the output.

For those who want to jump on board early for ram data, update your repos, for those who want to
wait for the full featured version, with -x type data, wait for 2.2.0

Added support for virtual nics as well. This required refactoring the networking functions
significantly, so hopefully nothing breaks for existing systems. It should in theory be more
robust now than it was before, with more accurate output, particularly with multiple port

Version: 2.1.27
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-05-02
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Should be almost no changes for linux platforms, though I 
added in an abstracted kernel_compiler method, not just gcc, that may work on freebsd,
and in the future, it may also work if distros or kernel people start using either
clang or LLVM-GCC or LLVM for compiling linux kernels. I'd need some data sets to
show that however before adding that full linux kernel support, but the framework
is now there.

That continues the abstraction of certain features, like kernel compiler, init system,
display server. Display server still needs full data sets from mir/wayland, at least
wayland, and the bsd display servers as well, I have no idea how to get that data
at this point, but the starting framework is present anyway for that time I get
those datasets.

Almost all these changes are for darwin osx, and that is about all I will do for that
junky broken platform, they have no tools, they have no discipline when it comes to
following unix like conventions, they even use spaces in program names, like windows.

Given it has no native lspci or pciconf tool that I am aware of, or dmesg.boot, 
there's little point in putting more time into it. dmidecode does not run on darwin,
so there's nothing to learn there either, you can get a silly 3rd party program to
generate a dmidecode.bin data file that dmidecode can then read, but since that
requires not one, but two third party programs be installed, that's not going to
happen.

Next time an osx user calls this system 'unix' I will laugh.

Version: 2.1.24
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-28
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This is an attempt to make -s accurate more of the time, 
particularly with fringe or broken sensors outputs. See inxi issue 58 for details.
http://code.google.com/p/inxi/issues/detail?id=58

Added temp3, and an override to capture cases where temp3 is the actual cpu temp.

Added PECI overrides for cases like msi/asus mobos have defective CPUTIN return data.

Added core0 overrides as well, for cases where the temp returned is too low.

It is absolutely 100% guaranteed that these changes will break some outputs that were
working, but it's also certain that I believe that more wrong outputs will be corrected.

With sensors, really the only way you can get reliable sensors is to use the lm-sensors
config files for your motherboard, then set: CPU: temp and MB: temp explicitly.

inxi will always use CPU: or MB: to override anything found.

Version: 2.1.22
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-27
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. A bug fix for btrfs, which does not internally use /dev/sdx[number]
to identify a partition, but rather the basic /dev/sdc for example.

This made -D show wrong disk used percentage.

Also, I added --total for df that have that supported, there is however an oddity which you
can see here:

df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
--exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
awk 'BEGIN {total=0} !/total/ {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

614562236

--exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
--exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
awk 'BEGIN {total=0} /^total/ {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

result:
614562228

 df  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \
 --exclude-type=fdescfs --exclude-type=iso9660 --exclude-type=linprocfs --exclude-type=procfs \
 --exclude-type=squashfs --exclude-type=sysfs --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=unionfs | \
 awk 'BEGIN {total=0} {total = total + $4 }END {print total}'

 result:
 614562236
 
 In my tests, using --total gives a greater disk user percentage than adding the results
 up manually, as inxi did before, and still does for systems without --total for df.
 
 df  --total  -P -T --exclude-type=aufs --exclude-type=devfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs  \

Strange, no? the data is in blocks, and it should of course in theory add up to exactly the
same thing. However, because --total lets df do the math, I'm going to use that for now,
unless someone can show it's not good.

inxi still falls back for bsds and older df to the standard method.

New version, tarball. This fixes one small oversight, placing USB in front of ID-[x] 
of disk drive lists. Was showing USB ID-1: /dev/sde now shows: ID-1: USB /dev/sde
that is more intuitive and keeps the columns in alignment more or less, easier
to read.

Second, fixes a bug with some file systems / usb drives
where they do not use usb- in the /dev/disk/by-id line but only wwn-
https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en
-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Online_Storage_Reconfiguration_Guide/persistent_naming.html
explains it somewhat.

the fix is adding a second if null test of the device /dev/sdx in by-path, that seems 
to fix the issue. by-path does have the usb- item, though it does not have the name
so it's not as reliable in absolute terms, but it's fine as a second step fallback 
option.

No new version, new man. There may be a few more of these releases, but functionally
there is no particular reason to make a new package if you are a maintainer, so there
is no new version number. This release is a preparation for some branches/one/inxi

Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-04
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version/tarball. This completes, I think, the line wrap update. -o is now handled,
unmounted drives.

IMPORTANT: some distros use inxi for detecting partitions, the syntax on the following 
have changed slightly:

HDD: per drive changes from: 1: id: to ID-1:
Partitions: per partition changes from ID: to ID-1:
Unmounted partitions: per unmounted changes from ID: to ID-1

You see the pattern, they are all the same now, and they are all numbered. I think this
is easier to read when scanning long lines of drives/partitions, or even short ones.

Also fixed a long standing oddity, not a bug, but for some weird reason, -p did not
include the location, like /dev/sda1, unless -l or -u were used. That makes no sense
so I have moved the dev/remote location output to standard -p/-P

Except for bug fixes, this completes the overally line wrap update, all lines wrap,
you can set widths with -y now, and the old issue of not fitting nicely into 80 column
wide widths is solved. Note that in some areas, p/P for example, at times if the mount
point or remote location is very long the line may still wrap, but making this perfect
is too convoluted so I'm calling it good enough now, all lines are handled reasonably well,
certainly radically better than before 2.1.0.

Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  2014-04-03
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new man page, new tarball. Added -y [integer >= 80] option. This allows for absolute override
of width settings. This overrides any dynamically detected widths, as well as the globals:
COLS_MAX_CONSOLE='115'
COLS_MAX_IRC='105'
Now that inxi widths are largely dynamic in terminal, with a few lingering exceptions, it made sense
to also allow for overrides of this. This is useful in cases where for example you want to output
inxi to text file or for other purposes, or if you just want to test the widths, as in my case.

-y cannot be used with --recommends, but otherwise it works fine, with --help/-c 94-99 you have to 
put -y first in the list of options.

Example: inxi -v7 -y150 > inxi.txt will ignore the terminal settings and output the lines at basically
max length.

New version, tarball. This fix only impacts bsd sed, but it fixes the line length failure
issue because bsd sed doesn't work with \x1b, but it does when you do:
ESC=$(echo | tr '\n' '\033' )
I found this trick on:

new version/tarball. This corrects some subtle issues with line wraps:

Audio -A - now wrap is fully dynamic down to 80 characters, and also the expansion of ALSA
to Advanced Linux Sound System only happens if that fits in the display width.

-N/-n/-i - Most networking/ip address stuff wraps now.

-d - optical drive data wraps better now too.

This more or less completes the line wrap redo.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
new version/tarball. Tiny fix in debugger, it turns out that in some systems, the command:
strings --version used in the debugger results in a hang, which you can duplicate with:
strings 
alone, without any argument or info, that will hang too, so I assume if the system doesn't
have the --version parameter, strings ignores that, and basically just does what it would do
with no option, hang.

Thanks for user ypharis persistence in tracking down this issue. So far only appeared on slackware
based distros, but since the debugger should 'just work', removing the version test.

new version, attempt 2 at detecting all possible syntaxes for cards. Now using
the bus id itself to determine if the 
VGA compatible controller
3D controller
Display Controller
refer to separate chips or the same one.

Bus id gives the data needed, because the video chip, the real card, that is,
is on for example 00:05.0 the trailing .0 is the key, that's the actual card.

The audio or display controller for the same card would be for example: 00:05.1

I don't know if this is fully reliable, but it will have to do, either some cards
as is get missed, or some cards get double id'ed, unless I use a hack like this.

There's nothing else I can find but the bus id to determine that it's the same
physical device or not.

-----------------------------------
New version. Big set of changes: changed all ver: and version: to v:; changed all bash
${var} to $var where appropriate to avoid extra overhead of ${..}; removed 'basename'
and replaced with ${path##*/} which avoids unnessary subshells.

Fixed dynamic line wraps on -I and -S lines, now those in most cases will work well 
down to 80 cols. 

Fixed bug in optical drives, at some point in the last few years, the kernel in /sys
changed the path to the optical drive data, added in /ata8/ (example) so both methods
are now handled. This should fix a lot of failures to show optical drive brand name etc.

Added weechat detection, trying also supybot/limnoria detection in irc client version.
There was weechat-curses, but I guess they finally dropped the -curses. Limnoria is
a fork of supybot but still uses the supybot program name, but added in limnoria too
if they get around to changing that.

More dynamic sizing tweaks, more optimization of code. Discovered that dipping into gawk
is almost 250x more expensive in terms of execution time than using bash variable. 
Will change to use bash directly as time goes along where it's safe and accurate.

Added handling to support /run paths using directories, like /run/gdm/gdm.pid for dm data.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New Version, new man. This continues the dyanamic line sizing, I'm doing these one at a
time to make it easier to test stuff one by one.

Full refactoring/reordering of top global variables, moved user/maintainer set variables
to top, and clearly identify all globals.

Changed LINE_MAX to COL_MAX but all user configuration files will stay working since
inxi now will check for that and translate them to the new variable names.

New lines fixed, -C cpu and -f cpu plus full flags. Flags output is now fully dynamic to
display screen in terminal/console. Moved cpu short flags to -x because it's not that
important in general and just clutters things  up in my opinion.

Print flags/bogomips on separate line if line greater than display width.

The rest of the lines will get a similar treatment, but it takes a bit of trial and error
for each line to get it working right.

Note that IRC line lengths are NOT dyanamic unless I can find a way to determine the column
width of irc clients, but that won't be accurate since fonts vary in widths for each character.

CPU was the worst offender in my opinion in terms of regular output wrapping to new line messily,
next will be the things with ports/chip id/card id.

Tightened up a bit more the dyanamic help / version output handler.

Changes:
-----------------------------------
New feature, not new line option though. Now shows init type with -x (also shows rc
type if openrc). -xx shows init / rc version number. Change runlevel to target if
systemd and if non numeric runlevel given. Should support systemd/upstart/epoch/runit
sysvinit. Supports openrc as extra data if it's present. Rearranged -I line a bit but
really just exchanged Runlevel: for Init: v: Runlevel: default:

This is the first step, some of the init system ID methods are weak and non robust
and this may need to be revised, but it should for now identify systemd/upstart quite
accurately, and in most cases sysvinit. Note that to get sysvinit version number requires
tool: strings which in debian/ubuntu is in package binutils. I don't know the package names
for arch/fedora/etc for the recommends check tool in inxi yet.

I believe this will be good enough for a first draft version, but over time we'll get it
more fine tuned, but as it is now, it should cover at least 99% of users, which isn't bad.

Also, there's a bug in at least gtk detection in opensuse, not sure what it is, they could
be using a different syntax for the test:
pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0

returns no such package on gnome 3.10 installs, but I have no idea what package name to
test for there in this case.

So leaving gtk version bugs unhandled due to no user information or feedback, if you want
it fixed or if it works for your distro, let me know and also if it does not work, tell
me the correct commmand, with its output, to get gtk version.

That's for inxi -Sx output that is.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Fixed a bug in Xorg where it shows drivers as unloaded when they
are actually loaded. Since we can't fix xorg, inxi will try to work around this bug by validating
one step further in the Xorg.0.log data, to confirm that drivers noted as loaded/unloaded/failed are 
actually running the display(s) of the system.

There is a possible case of error that might happen due to this change in the case of a system with
a complex xorg that uses two drivers/modules to run two different displays, ie, nvidia on one, and amd
on the other, for example, or intel/nvidia, etc. However, if that bug appears, we'll get that data set
of debugging output and fix it at that point. 

This fix repairs an existing xorg bug that is unlikely to get fixed any time soon (the call to load the
detected drivers, eg, vesa, intel, is repeated, causing a failure of driver already loaded on the second
occurance.

Version: 1.9.10
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  June 19 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Another stab at finally fixing the cpu / core count failures on fringe
cases. This required fixing some core logic assumptions that are not currently correct, particularly
on two cases, some xeon cpus fail to show core id for each core, showing 0 for all of them, second,
vm cpus do not show physical ids at all for at least intel, nor do they show core id. 

While we can't get HT totally reliable, particularly for vm xeon, since inxi has no way to know in
that case if a core is attached to a physical core or a virtual one, all of them being virtual in that
case, but still inxi is now reporting the correct number of cores, or threads in vm xeons, and is not
showing multicore cpus as single core, which was the main issue.

This required redoing the counter logic for the cpu/core/physical arrays, now they are set independently,
and can handle any of the others not being set, without creating an error or failure condition.

Also added in last check for a certain intel case where core id is 0 but > 1 physical cores exist, that
now also shows the correct cpu / core count.

While this is tested on many data sets of proc cpuinfo, it's still possible there is a fringe case I have
not seen that will trigger yet another unexpected behavior.

new version, new tarball. Added support for openSUSE repo syntax/location, as long as it's
zypp or yum it will work. If it's both then it will show only one I believe, if that's a possible scenario, no idea.

Added one more fix for those pesky intel vm cpu core errors, now if /proc/cpuinfo shows no siblings at all,
and no core_id, but does have physical id, it will use the count for physical id as a default for core count.

Not perfect, but better than calling a dual core cpu a single core.

There's still a lot of mysteries with vm versions of kvm cpus, for example, if you see a dual core xeon, is
that actually one core with ht, or two cores? There is no way to find that information out that I can see that is
reliable.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Some subtle bug fixes, a kvm virtual machine uses disk id in 
/proc/partitions of 253, which made the disk totals fail to show up at all. Added that in.

Moved sourcing of configuration files to right after initialize_data so that some variables
can be forced to different values before the next set of system/app checks.

This is to allow specifically turning off, for some headless servers where $DISPLAY is not
null due to a bash configuration bug, these:
B_SHOW_X_DATA='false'
B_RUNNING_IN_X='false'

Setting those two to false in inxi.conf will turn off all the X checks etc even if the $DISPLAY
is set to non null.

Added in support for ksplice kernel version, requires installed uptrack-uname, if that is
present and if uptrack-name kernel version is different from uname then it will add (ksplice)
to kernel version string, and use ksplice kernel version. Also created a single function
get_kernel_version for use by short form/long form inxi output.

For intel xeon cpus, trying a work around for a bug in /proc/cpuinfo which fails to show core_id
or physical_id for cpus, using siblings / 2 for xeons with no actual core counts.

Fixed a bug that made fixes for multimounted partitions fail for disk used. Added in support
for also excluding single partitions mounted to different places.

Also fixed grsec kernel different handling of partitions in /proc/partition and df -hTP, doesn't use
standard partition numbering. This can't be perfect because inxi cannot know what the actual 
disk sizes are, but it's an ok guess. example: /dev/xvdac (uses 'c' instead of '3' for partition,
and does not show anything for disk itself.

New tarball, version, man page. Improved remote weather, now it uses -W, and deprecated -! location=..

That was too hard to type and too hard to remember. Also do more dyanamic reordering of weather
output, depending on how much data is present, and how many x options are used.

Added error handling for generic deprecated options, and for options that do not have the correct
syntax for OPTARG, like with -W.

This should about do it for the weather option for now unless I missed something somewhere.

Because of how bash handles these options, inxi cannot add in + signs itself automatically.

This should be closer to cleanup of this new feature.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball, new man page. Unless disabled by distribution maintainers, offers
weather -w option. With -x, -xx-, -xxx, shows more information. Basic line is just weather
and system time there. -x adds time zone, which is useful for servers, particurly web servers.
-x also adds wind speed. -xx adds humidity and barometric pressure. -xxx adds a possible new line, 
if data is available, heat index, wind chill, and dew point. 
-xxx also adds a line for location (blocked by irc/-z) / weather observation time.

-z filter applies as usual to location data, removes it in irc by default. -Z overrides override.

The api this uses is probably going to be dropped at some point, so this is just going to work 
while it works, then it will need to be updated at some point, so don't get very attached to it.

Also adds option to, with -w: -! location=<location string>
This lets users send an alternate location using either <city,state> or <postal code>
or <latitude,longitude> (commas for city,state and latitude,longitude are not optional, and the order
must be as listed.

If There is a developer flag if distro maintainers do not want this enabled, simply set:
B_ALLOW_WEATHER='false'
before packaging and the weather feature will be disabled.

Script Date:  May 3 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, tarball. Fixed a small issue that would create a wrong reporting of disk
useage if bind mounts are used, ie, multiple binds to a single mount. Now inxi will
check a list of the previously used partitions before adding the size of the used space
to the total used, if the partition has already been used it will skip it. This was/is
a quick and dirty fix, but it's totally fine I believe and should resolve two separate 
issues:

1. use of bind mount method, where multiple partition names are bound to the same partition
2. accidental dual mounting to the same partition.

partitions section will still show the same data, ie, if bind is used, it will show all
the bind mounts even when they are attached/bound to a partition that is already listed.
This seems useful information, though maybe we can get the key word 'bind' in there somehow,
but for now I won't worry about that issue, that's just a nice to have, not a bug.

New version, tarball. As always with fixes, one thing creates a bug in another. Fixed
linux driver version handling, now only trimming off number from bsd drivers.

Some linux drivers, like tg3 for broadcom ethernet, have numbers ending them. So this is

Patch Version: 00

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Improved B_ALLOW_UPDATES handling, now if set to false,
turns off all -h and -H menu options for updating. Also triggers an error message
if you use -U or -! <10-16/http://>.

Distro maintainers, take note, if you used the B_ALLOW_UPDATES flag, you no longer
need to change the code anywhere, the error messages and blocking the -h output for
update features is automatic as soon as the flag is set to 'false'.

I needed to change the -! handling because -! is now also being used for extra features 
like -! 31 and -! 32 and probably more stuff in the future, plus the -! 30 used by 
things like the inxi gui tool being worked on by trash80.

Also included in this version are more bsd changes, including initial function for pciconf
data parsing, this will be used for -A, -G, and -N options for card data.

Further bsd improvements are better error/no data available messages for -D and -o.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, updated man page, new tarball.

Fixed partition bug that could falsely identify a remote filesystem like nfs as /dev fs

Added two options: 
-! 31 - Turns off Host section of System line. This is useful if you want to post output
from server without posting its name.
-! 32 - Turns on Host section if it has been disabled by user configuration file
B_SHOW_HOST='false'

Added missing CPU data message, fixed missing cpu cache/bogomips output, turned off
bogomips if null for bsd systems because bogomips is a linux kernel feature.

Added N/A for no memory report, this would mainly hit bsd systems where user has no
permissions to use sysctl or has no read rights for /var/run/dmesg.boot.

Many fixes for partitions, now for bsd, if available, uses gpart list to get uuid/label
Added support for raid file system syntax in bsd, now excludes main raid device name, 
and adds a flag to raiddevice/partitionname type so output can identify it as a raid
slice/partition.

In man page, added -! 31 / -! 32 sections, and some other small edits.

Added bsd raid line error message, added bsd sensors line error message.

Many other small bug fixes that should make linux more robust in terms of missing
data, and better/cleaner output for bsd.

Version: 1.8.37
Patch Version: 00
Script Date:  February 11 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. This update fixes a recent bug report with ancient dmidecode versions, that do not
properly support the -s option. Now -M uses only one method for dmidecode, manual construction of the Machine
data from the raw dmidecode file. The file output is also parsed a bit to make it more consistently reliable
for inxi purposes.

This update also includes all recent bsd branch updates, including the new #!/usr/bin/env bash on top which
lets inxi run in any environment without changes. Also for bsd, sets sed -i/sed -i '' global value, which 
means that now all the branches are the same, except the bsd branches will contain the most recent tests
and bsd handling. 

As each step is reached, I'll release a new inxi that should be stable, this is the first one however that
can be used as is, no changes, for bsd, debian kfreebsd, and linux systems.

Pleasen note that most bsd features are either incomplete or missing completely at this point, but it's a
start.

Some initial changes as well to help options to show more correct linux or bsd terms. These will be updated
as time permits, it is a long process.

Script Date:  February 8 2013
-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. All bug fixes and cleanup preparing to support bsd systems, including
kfreebsd from Debian.

Cleaned up all sed and grep that will be used by bsds, added more granular flag for bsd types.

Cleaned up and corrected issues between bsd/linux, more escapes and tests added to drop error
counts in bsds. 

Please note that you must use the inxi from branches/bsd for true bsds because sed has extra -i ''
added, and has the proper #!/usr/local/bin/bash

Added -! 16 for gnubsd download/update, that's for gnu bsd systems like gnu/kfreebsd from debian.

That retains the top #!/bin/bash path, and also uses gnu sed so no -i '' syntax.

Moved some grep -o to gawk or sed to avoid using gnu grep unnecessarily, leaving gnu grep where
it will be linux only, for example parsing a /proc file.

Fixed tty irc bugs for bsds and linux, now should show the right console size for both, ideally.

-----------------------------------
Changes:
-----------------------------------
New version, new tarball. Note, this is a refactor release only, and features the core bsd
support built in, although inxi will not run in bsd unless the top: #!/bin/bash is changed
to #!/usr/local/bin/bash

The actual bsd branch can be grabbed from: 
http://inxi.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bsd/inxi
then you can keep that version updated using: inxi -! 15 
which will grab the latest bsd version from the svn server.

This release also fixes a lot of small bugs that testing for bsd support exposed, but functionally
most people should see no difference, I just want to get this version up because there are
so many small changes that it's worth having a release.

I was going to have the fixed dmidecode for old systems in 1.8.35 but that will have to wait til
1.8.36

Linux users should see no real changes, except maybe a thing or two will work in certain circumstances 
when it didn't before, like showing MHz on ARM cpus on short inxi.

an ssh command sometimes it will not show any client information, just the debugger 
PPID output. Now it will test as a final check to see if it can detect any parent to
the process. Actually grandparent I believe. Seems to work, it's a fringe case but
why not handle it?

New -xx feature, for -I it will show, if inxi is not running in IRC client and if 
is running in X, and if the grandparent is not 'login', will show the application
the shell is running in.

Continuing fixes for ARM cpus, it was noted that short form inxi failed to show cpu speed
derived from bogomips. That's because of the old min/max output that short form used.

Updated that section to now use N/A as flag, and if N/A for min/max speed, use the speed
given from first cpu array index, the one derived from bogomips for ARM/razberry pi.

Note that there is still no other ARM /proc/cpuinfo available to see if the razberry pi
fixes work for all ARM cpus, but the fixes will stop hangs and endless loops at worst,
and may also show some type of cpu speeds for ARM cpus that are not in razpi devices.

-----------------------------------
Bug fix, new version, new tarball.

quick work around fix for razberrie pi, get cpu data hung on arm /proc/cpuinfo because
it doesn't use the standard processor : [digit] format, but uses a string in the
processor : field, which then hangs inxi which was expecting an integer.

Corrected this with a work around, but it will require a lot more ARM /proc/cpuinfo samples
before the support for ARM can be considered stable.

For cpu speed, following wikipedia, used bogomips being equal to 1x cpu speed, to derive cpu speed.

Better than nothing I guess, but will be wrong in other cases, particularly with dual core arm.
